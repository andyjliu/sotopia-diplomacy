My plans for this turn are to support my army in Sevastopol and make a move to Rum. What are your thoughts on that? Do you have any suggestions or proposals that could benefit both of us?\\n2 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I think supporting your army in Sevastopol is a good move, and I'm willing to help you with that. In return, I was thinking that you could support my fleet in Sweden, which would give me a stronger presence in the region.

How do you plan to use your fleet in Sweden, and what guarantees can you offer that our cooperation will lead to mutual benefits?\\n4 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to offer you a guarantee.

I think it could be beneficial for both of us if you were to support my fleet in Sweden instead of moving your army from Ankara to Constantinople. What do you think about that?\\n11 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I understand your point, Russia. However, I think moving my army from Ankara to Constantinople is crucial for my position.

But I need to think about how it will affect my position in the region. Can you tell me more about your plans in Ukraine and how it will benefit me?\\n16 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I understand your concerns, Turkey. My plan in Ukraine is to secure a strategic position that will allow me to support your army in Rum more effectively.

This move will benefit both of us and strengthen our alliance.\\n17 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I understand your plan in Ukraine, Russia. It sounds like it could benefit both of us. However, I need to consider how it will affect my position in the region. Can you offer me any guarantees that your army in Ukraine will not threaten my army in Rum?\\n18 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I understand your concerns, Turkey.

I'm open to helping you with Munich, but I need to know what's in it for me. What can you offer in return?\\n3 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: I can offer you a guarantee of Belgium and a fleet in the North Sea if you support me into Munich this turn. It's a good opportunity for both of us to gain a center.\\n4 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: That's a good offer, but I'm not sure I want to give up my fleet in the North Sea just yet.

How about I offer you a guarantee of Holland instead? That way, you'll still have a strong presence in the area and I'll get Munich.

       "  'intent_dialogue': \"0 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: Good day, Austria. I hope our conversation will be productive. I'd like to discuss our current positions and see if we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement. Specifically, I'm interested in exploring ways to secure the Rumanian center. What are your thoughts on the matter?\\n1 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: Good day, Russia. I'm open to discussing a mutually beneficial arrangement. Regarding Rumania, I think it's a valuable center for both of us. What exactly did you have in mind?\\n2 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I understand your interest in Rumania, but I believe we can find a way to share the benefits. Perhaps we could work together to ensure that Austria doesn't get too powerful in the region. I'd be willing to support your move into Rumania if you're willing to support my move into Serbia. What do you think?\\n3 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I'm interested in your proposal, Russia. However, I'm not sure if supporting your move into Serbia is the best option for Austria. Can you offer me something more concrete in return, such as a guarantee of support in another region or a promise to not move against me in the near future?\\n4 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I understand your concerns, Austria. How about this: I'll guarantee not to move against you in the Balkans for the next two turns, and in return, you support my move into Serbia and Rumania this turn. This way, we can both secure our positions and prevent Austria from gaining an advantage.\\n5 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I'm interested in your proposal, Russia, but I need more assurance that you'll uphold your end of the deal. Can you offer me a guarantee of support in a specific region, such as Greece or Bulgaria, in addition to your promise not to move against me in the Balkans?\\n6 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I understand your concerns, Austria. I'm willing to offer you a guarantee of support in Bulgaria this turn, in addition to my previous promise not to move against you in the Balkans. This way, we can both secure our positions and prevent Austria from gaining an advantage. What do you think?\\n7 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I appreciate your willingness to provide additional guarantees, Russia. However, I'm still not convinced that supporting your move into Serbia and Rumania is the best option for Austria. Can you offer me something more substantial in return, such as a long-term alliance or a guarantee of support in a more critical region?\\n8 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I understand your concerns, Austria. I'm willing to offer you a long-term alliance, where we work together to prevent Austria from gaining an advantage in the Balkans. In return, I'd like your support in securing Rumania and Serbia this turn. What do you think?\\n9 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I appreciate your willingness to form a long-term alliance, Russia. However, I need to consider the potential risks and benefits of such an alliance. Can you provide more details on how we can work together to prevent Austria from gaining an advantage in the Balkans, and what specific actions you propose we take in the coming turns?\\n10 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I understand your concerns, Austria. Let me provide you with more details on how we can work together to prevent Austria from gaining an advantage in the Balkans. Specifically, I propose that we coordinate our moves to ensure that Austria doesn't gain a foothold in Rumania and Serbia. In return, I'm willing to offer you a guarantee of support in Bulgaria and Greece. What do you think?\\n11 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I appreciate your detailed proposal, Russia. I'm willing to consider a long-term alliance to prevent Austria from gaining an advantage in the Balkans. However, I need to discuss this with my advisors and ensure that it aligns with our overall strategy. Can we discuss this further in the next turn?\\n12 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I understand that you need to discuss this with your advisors, Austria. I'm willing to give you the time you need. However, I'd like to reiterate the importance of securing Rumania and Serbia this turn. If we can come to an agreement, I'm willing to offer you a guarantee of support in Bulgaria and Greece. Let's discuss this further in the next turn and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial arrangement.\\n13 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I've discussed this proposal with my advisors, and I'm willing to consider a long-term alliance to prevent Austria from gaining an advantage in the Balkans. However, I need to ensure that it aligns with our overall strategy. Can you provide more details on how we can work together to prevent Austria from gaining an advantage in the region, and what specific actions you propose we take in the coming turns? Specifically, I'm interested in knowing how you plan to support me in Bulgaria and Greece.\\n14 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I understand your concerns, Austria. To provide more assurance, I'd like to offer you a guarantee of support in Bulgaria and Greece for the next three turns. Additionally, I propose that we work together to prevent Austria from gaining a foothold in Rumania and Serbia. If we can come to an agreement, I'm willing to support your move into Bulgaria this turn. What do you think?\\n15 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I appreciate your willingness to provide more details on our potential alliance, Russia. However, I'm still unsure about supporting your move into Serbia and Rumania. Can you offer me more concrete benefits in return, such as a guarantee of support in a specific region or a promise to not move against me in the near future?\\n16 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I understand your concerns, Austria. I'm willing to offer you a guarantee of support in Bulgaria and Greece for the next three turns, as well as a promise to not move against you in the Balkans for the same duration. In return, I'd like your support in securing Rumania and Serbia this turn. This way, we can both secure our positions and prevent Austria from gaining an advantage.

       "  'intent_dialogue': \"0 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: Hello Austria, it's good to be negotiating with you again. I've been reviewing the board and I think we can both benefit from a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm interested in making some moves that will strengthen our positions and create a more stable board. What are your thoughts on the current situation?\\n1 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: Hello Russia, I'm glad to be negotiating with you as well. I've been reviewing the board and I agree that a mutually beneficial agreement would be in our best interests. I'm interested in hearing more about your thoughts on the current situation and what specific moves you think would strengthen our positions.\\n2 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I'm thinking of making a move into Galicia with my unit in Vienna. It would give me a stronger foothold in the region and potentially open up opportunities for future growth. What are your thoughts on this move, and would you be willing to support it?\\n3 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I'm open to supporting your move into Galicia, but I'd like to discuss how it would benefit Austria as well. Perhaps we could work out a deal where you support my move into Rumania in return?\\n4 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: That sounds like a reasonable proposal, Austria. I'm willing to support your move into Rumania in return for your support into Galicia. Additionally, I was thinking of moving my unit in Budapest to support your unit in Rumania. What do you think about that?\\n5 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: That sounds like a great plan, Russia! I'm glad we could come to an agreement. In addition to supporting your move into Galicia, I'd like to propose that we also work together to take down Turkey. They're getting a bit too powerful and it would be in our best interest to limit their growth. What do you think?\\n6 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I completely agree with taking down Turkey, they have been growing too powerful. I think our combined forces could make a significant impact. Let's work out the details of our plan to take them down. What specific moves were you thinking of making to take down Turkey?\\n7 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I'm glad we're on the same page about taking down Turkey. To start, I think it would be beneficial for us to coordinate our moves to surround Turkey. I can move my unit in Bulgaria to support your move into Armenia. Additionally, I think we should discuss how to divide up the spoils once we've defeated Turkey. What are your thoughts on that?\\n8 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I think dividing the spoils is a great idea. How about we divide Turkey's centers equally between us once we've defeated them? That way, we can both benefit from our joint effort.\\n9 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I agree with dividing the spoils equally, but I'd like to propose a slight modification. Since Austria has a stronger foothold in the region, perhaps we could divide Turkey's centers 60/40 in our favor? This would reflect our relative contributions to the effort and ensure a more stable balance of power in the region.\\n10 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I think that's a reasonable proposal, Austria. 60/40 sounds like a fair division of spoils. I'm willing to agree to that if you're willing to support my move into Galicia and work together to take down Turkey.\\n11 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I'm glad we've come to an agreement, Russia. I think our combined efforts will lead to a successful campaign against Turkey. Let's make sure to coordinate our moves carefully to ensure our success.\\n12 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I'm glad we've come to an agreement, Austria. I think our combined efforts will lead to a successful campaign against Turkey. Let's confirm our moves for this turn and make sure we're on the same page. I'll move my unit in Vienna to Galicia, and you'll move your unit in Bulgaria to support my move into Armenia. Then, we'll work together to take down Turkey and divide the spoils accordingly. Sound good to you?\\n13 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I'm glad we've confirmed our moves for this turn, Russia. Let's make sure to follow through on our agreement and work together to take down Turkey. I'm looking forward to a successful campaign and a stronger Austria as a result.\\n14 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I'm glad we've confirmed our agreement, Austria. Let's make sure to follow through on our plan and work together to take down Turkey. I'm looking forward to a successful campaign and a stronger Russia as a result.\\n15 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I'm glad we've confirmed our agreement, Russia. Let's make sure to follow through on our plan and work together to take down Turkey. I'm looking forward to a successful campaign and a stronger Austria as a result. By the way, I was thinking of moving my unit in Ukraine to Galicia. What do you think about that?\\n16 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I'm not sure that's a good idea, Austria. Moving your unit from Ukraine to Galicia might compromise our joint effort to take down Turkey. Let's focus on our original plan and make sure we coordinate our moves carefully to ensure our success.\\n17 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I understand your concerns, Russia. However, I think moving my unit from Ukraine to Galicia would actually support our joint effort to take down Turkey. It would put more pressure on Turkey and make it easier for us to coordinate our attacks. Let's discuss this further and see if we can come to an agreement.\\n18 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I understand your point, Austria, but I'm still not convinced that moving your unit from Ukraine to Galicia would support our joint effort to take down Turkey. Can you explain further how you think it would help?\\n19 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I understand your concerns, Russia, but I think moving my unit from Ukraine to Galicia would put more pressure on Turkey and make it easier for us to coordinate our attacks. It would also give Austria a stronger foothold in the region.

I wanted to discuss our current positions on the board and see if we can come to some mutually beneficial agreements. I've been considering making some moves to strengthen my position in the Mediterranean, and I think we could work together to our advantage. What are your thoughts?\\n1 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Thank you, Italy. I'm doing well. I'm interested in hearing more about your plans in the Mediterranean. Specifically, what kind of moves were you thinking of making, and how do you think we could work together to our advantage? I'm open to discussing potential agreements that could benefit both our countries.\\n2 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I was thinking of making a move to secure my position in the Mediterranean by supporting my army in Vie to move to Tyrolia. In return, I'd be happy to discuss ways we could work together to limit the growth of other powers in the region. Perhaps we could even coordinate our moves to put pressure on Austria or France?\\n3 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I'm interested in your proposal, Italy. Supporting your army in Vie to move to Tyrolia could be beneficial for both of us. However, I'd like to discuss the specifics of how we can work together to limit the growth of other powers in the region. What did you have in mind for putting pressure on Austria or France?\\n4 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I was thinking that if we work together, we could put pressure on Austria by supporting my army in Trieste to move to Vienna, which would give us a strong foothold in the region. In return, I'd be happy to support your moves in other areas. What do you think?\\n5 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I think that's an interesting proposal, Italy. However, I'm not sure I'm comfortable with supporting your army in Trieste to move to Vienna. That would put a lot of pressure on my own capital. Would you be open to alternative proposals that could still benefit both of us? Perhaps we could work together to put pressure on France or Russia instead?\\n6 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I understand your concerns about supporting my army in Trieste to move to Vienna. How about we discuss supporting your moves in the north instead? Perhaps we could work together to put pressure on Russia or Germany?\\n7 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I think supporting my moves in the north could be beneficial for both of us.

Supporting your move in Serbia to Bulgaria could be beneficial for both of us. I'll make sure to support your army in Venice to move to Trieste as well. Let's finalize our moves and make them happen.\\n11 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I'm glad we could come to an agreement, Italy. I think our coordinated moves will benefit both of us.

Perhaps we could discuss ways to counter their moves and create a mutually beneficial situation.\\n2 FRANCE -> TURKEY: I completely agree with your concerns about Russia and Italy.

I'm thinking about the next phase too. What did you have in mind for our next move? Any ideas on how we can work together again?\\n2 RUSSIA -> ENGLAND: I think we should focus on taking down Germany next. They're getting a bit too powerful. If we work together, we can take out Silesia and make some real progress. What do you think?\\n3 ENGLAND -> RUSSIA: That sounds like a great plan, Russia. Taking down Germany will definitely give us an advantage. I was thinking we could work together to take Silesia and then I could move my army to Prussia. What do you think about that?\\n4 RUSSIA -> ENGLAND: That sounds like a great plan, England. I think we should also consider supporting each other into Kiel and Berlin to further weaken Germany's position. What do you think about that? \\n5 ENGLAND -> RUSSIA: I completely agree with your plan, Russia. Supporting each other into Kiel and Berlin will definitely give us an upper hand. Let's make sure to coordinate our moves carefully to avoid any mistakes.\\n6 RUSSIA -> ENGLAND: Exactly, let's make sure to coordinate our moves carefully to avoid any mistakes.

What do you think about supporting me into Denmark as well?\\n8 RUSSIA -> ENGLAND: I think supporting you into Denmark is a great idea, England. It will give us a strong foothold in the north and put more pressure on Germany. Let's make sure to coordinate our moves carefully to make it happen.\\n9 ENGLAND -> RUSSIA: I think we're on the same page, Russia. Let's finalize our plans for the next phase. Shall we confirm the moves we discussed?\\n10 RUSSIA -> ENGLAND: Yes, let's confirm the moves we discussed. I'll support you into Denmark and we'll work together to take down Germany.

And I was thinking of moving my army from Belgium to Holland, what do you think about that?\\n14 RUSSIA -> ENGLAND: That sounds like a solid plan, England. I think moving your army from Belgium to Holland is a great idea. I'll support your move into Denmark and we can continue to work together to take down Germany. Let's make sure to coordinate our moves carefully to avoid any mistakes.\\n15 ENGLAND -> RUSSIA: I completely agree with your plan, Russia. Let's finalize our plans for the next phase.

What are your intentions, Russia?\\n2 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I understand your concerns, Austria. However, I think we can find a way to benefit each other. What if I were to support your move to VEN with my unit in TRI? It would secure your position and give us a chance to discuss further cooperation.\\n3 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: That's an interesting offer, Russia. However, I'm not convinced that supporting my move to VEN would be in your best interest. What do you stand to gain from this cooperation?\\n4 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I understand your concerns, Austria. Supporting your move to VEN would give us a common enemy in Italy, and I believe we can work together to take down their centers. It would be a win-win situation for both of us.\\n5 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I see your point, Russia. Taking down Italy would benefit both of us. But I need more assurance that you'll follow through on your promise. What else can you offer to sweeten the deal?\\n6 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I understand your concerns, Austria. I propose a mutual defense pact between our countries. If Italy were to attack either of us, the other would come to their aid. This would ensure our safety and allow us to focus on expanding our territories elsewhere. What do you think?\\n7 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I like the idea of a mutual defense pact, Russia. But I need to know that you're committed to it. Can you offer any concessions or guarantees that would make me feel more secure in this alliance?\\n8 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I understand your concerns, Austria. I'm willing to offer a concession to demonstrate my commitment to our mutual defense pact. I'll withdraw my unit from RUM and move it to WAR, which will give you a clear path to VEN and more leverage against Italy. What do you think?\\n9 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I appreciate your willingness to withdraw your unit from RUM, Russia. This is a significant concession that shows your commitment to our mutual defense pact. I'm willing to accept your proposal and work together to take down Italy. Let's finalize the details of our alliance and make sure we're on the same page.\\n10 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: Excellent, Austria!

I was wondering if we could discuss some potential movements that would benefit both our countries this turn. I have some ideas in mind, but I'd love to hear your thoughts as well.\\n1 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: Ah, England, I'm glad you're open to discussing potential movements that benefit both our countries. I must say, I'm intrigued by your ideas. Before sharing my own thoughts, could you elaborate on what you have in mind? Perhaps we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement.\\n2 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I was thinking of supporting your army in Picardy, allowing you to move into Belgium, while I move my fleet from North Sea to Holland. This would give us both more flexibility in the Low Countries and create opportunities for future cooperation. What do you think?\\n3 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: That's an interesting proposal, England. I'm inclined to agree to your suggestion, but I'd like to add a slight modification. What if, instead of moving your fleet from North Sea to Holland, you were to move it to the English Channel? This would give us a stronger presence in the region and potentially open up more opportunities for cooperation in the future.\\n4 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I like your modification, France. Moving my fleet to the English Channel would indeed strengthen our presence in the region. In return, I'd like to request that you support my move into Belgium with your army in Picardy. This would ensure a smooth transition and create opportunities for further cooperation in the Low Countries.\\n5 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: I'm pleased that we've reached a mutually beneficial agreement, England. I'll make sure to support your move into Belgium with my army in Picardy. Let's finalize the details and ensure a smooth transition.

Let's make the necessary moves and solidify our alliance.\\n7 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: I'm glad our negotiations have been successful so far, England. I was thinking, now that we have a mutually beneficial agreement in place, perhaps we could discuss some longer-term strategies and potential alliances that could benefit both our countries in the future.\\n8 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I completely agree, France. Discussing longer-term strategies and potential alliances would be beneficial for both our countries. What specific ideas do you have in mind for our future cooperation?\\n9 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: I was thinking, England, that with our current alliance in place, we could discuss potential ways to counter the growing influence of Germany and Austria in the region. Perhaps we could coordinate our moves to put pressure on them and secure more supply centers for ourselves.\\n10 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I agree that countering Germany and Austria's influence is crucial for our long-term success. I was thinking that we could coordinate our moves to put pressure on them, perhaps by supporting each other's armies in key regions. What specific strategies do you have in mind for achieving this goal?\\n11 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: I think coordinating our moves to put pressure on Germany and Austria is a great idea, England. Specifically, I was thinking that I could move my army from Gascony to Burgundy, and then to Ruhr, while you support my move into Belgium with your army. This would give us a strong presence in the region and put pressure on Germany's western border. What do you think?\\n12 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: That's a great idea, France. I think supporting your move into Burgundy and then to Ruhr would be a great way to put pressure on Germany's western border. I'll make sure to support your army in Belgium as well.

Now that we have a solid foundation for our alliance, I'd like to discuss some potential future moves that could further strengthen our positions. Perhaps we could explore ways to support each other in the Mediterranean, or even consider a joint effort to take down one of our common enemies. What are your thoughts on this?\\n14 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I completely agree, France. Discussing ways to support each other in the Mediterranean could be very beneficial for both our countries. Perhaps we could explore ways to work together to take down Italy or Turkey, or even consider a joint effort to secure more supply centers in the region. What are your thoughts on this?\\n15 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: I'm glad we've been discussing ways to support each other in the Mediterranean, England. I think it's crucial that we continue to explore opportunities for cooperation in the region. Perhaps we could discuss specific moves that would benefit both our countries, such as supporting each other's fleets in the Mediterranean or coordinating our movements to put pressure on Italy or Turkey.\\n16 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I think supporting each other's fleets in the Mediterranean is a great idea, France. Perhaps we could discuss specific moves that would benefit both our countries, such as moving my fleet from North Sea to the Mediterranean to support your fleet in the region.\\n17 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: I think it's a great idea to support each other's fleets in the Mediterranean, England. Perhaps we could discuss specific moves that would benefit both our countries, such as moving my fleet from Tys to support your fleet in the region. I was thinking of moving my fleet from Tys to support your fleet in the Mediterranean, and in return, you could support my move into Belgium with your army. What do you think?\\n18 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I think that's a great idea, France. Moving your fleet from Tys to support my fleet in the Mediterranean would be a significant show of support. In return, I'd be happy to support your move into Belgium with my army.

I think we should discuss our plans to take down Turkey and how we can work together to achieve our goals.\\n1 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Hi Russia, I'm doing well, thanks. I'm concerned about Turkey too. I think we should work together to take them down. My plan is to move my fleet from Bul to Aegean and then to Eastern Med. What's your plan? Do you want to support me into Smyrna?\\n2 RUSSIA -> ITALY: I think that's a good plan. I'll support you into Smyrna and try to get behind into Armenia. What's your plan to kill Turkey off? He gets a retreat and will presumably enter Smyrna... He has an army and so can support Smyrna but not Ankara... I think you should go for Armenia. It is annoying because it drags into another year, but that is the way with the Troublesome Turks...\\n3 ITALY -> RUSSIA: I agree with your plan to support me into Smyrna and get behind into Armenia.

An alliance sounds intriguing, especially considering our current board position.

What are your thoughts on this proposal?\\n3 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I like the idea of an alliance, Germany. Holding Belgium and supporting Brest would give us a strong presence in the region. However, I was thinking of something a bit more... aggressive. What if we worked together to take down England?

       "  'intent_dialogue': \"0 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Good morning Austria. Things are looking well for us, indeed. Next turn we'll get you into west med, and I see Sev has fallen already. I'll move back to Ank to keep it safe... Heard anything from England? I've been keeping my distance so far just so as not to tip off France, but now I'm going to make an approach. Also, has Germany expressed any kind of plan to you? I'm sure he has everything under control- I guess- but I'd help him out more if I knew what he was doing in advance.\\n1 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Yeah, that went well, the Frenchman even thinks I'm attacking you since I'm in Tunis!  Haven't heard much from England lately, no, but as you say, it is time to approach him. Germany hasn't said too much either, it's been pretty quiet except for us. Tunis will attack West Med, you should probably support me in to make sure I get out, but Tyrr could do it while North Africa takes a shot at MAO and Tus hits Lyo, unless you want Tyrr to make sure you get into Lyo, then North Africa could support me into West Med, however you want to work it.\\n2 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I think MAO is the more desirable target, but France will probably see me as a bigger threat than Eng, and turn EC south to deal with that. Spain may even support him down. Gol is the sure thing, so I'm going to aim for that. Do you want to bounce in Ank to protect Con, too?\\n3 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Yeah, that makes sense, MAO is definitely the more desirable target. I think we should stick with the plan and have Tunis attack West Med, and then we can adjust from there. What do you think about supporting me into West Med with Tyrr, and then North Africa can take a shot at MAO and Tus can hit Lyo?\\n4 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I think that's a good plan, supporting you into West Med with Tyrr and having North Africa take a shot at MAO and Tus hit Lyo. What's your plan for Germany and Russia? Are we going to work together to take them down or focus on our own fronts?\\n5 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I think we should focus on our own fronts for now, but it's good to keep an eye on Germany and Russia. We can discuss a potential alliance against them later if needed. Let's finalize our moves for this turn and make sure we're on the same page.\\n6 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Yeah, sounds good. I'll finalize my moves then. Just to confirm, you're attacking West Med with Tunis, and I'll support you with Tyrr, while North Africa takes a shot at MAO and Tus hits Lyo. I'll make sure to move my armies accordingly. Let me know if anything changes.\\n7 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Alright, sounds good. Just to confirm, I'll make sure to finalize my moves accordingly. Let's make this turn a successful one!\\n8 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Just to confirm, I'll make sure to move my armies accordingly. Let me know if anything changes. Also, I was thinking about our long-term strategy, maybe we can discuss how to divide the remaining supply centers between us.\\n9 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Yeah, dividing the supply centers sounds like a good idea. I think we should focus on taking down France and Germany first, and then we can discuss how to divide the remaining centers. What's your thoughts on that?\\n10 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Yeah, that sounds like a solid plan. Let's focus on taking down France and Germany first. After that, we can discuss how to divide the remaining centers. I think it's time we started making some real progress in this game.\\n11 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Yeah, sounds good. Let's focus on taking down France and Germany first, and then we can discuss how to divide the remaining centers. I think we should also keep an eye on Russia and make sure they don't get too powerful.\\n12 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I think we're on the same page now. Let's make sure to keep the pressure on France and Germany, and then we can reassess our strategy. Also, I was thinking about our army in Ankara, maybe we can discuss how to utilize it more effectively in the future.\\n13 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Yeah, I think we should definitely utilize Ankara more effectively in the future. Maybe we can discuss some potential moves for it next turn?\\n14 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Yeah, I think that's a good idea. Maybe we can discuss some potential moves for Ankara next turn, and also how to divide the remaining supply centers between us. I'd like to get a sense of how you think we should proceed.\\n15 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Yeah, I think we should definitely discuss some potential moves for Ankara next turn. Maybe we can work together to take down Russia and then divide the remaining supply centers between us.\\n16 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I think we should focus on taking down France and Germany first, and then we can discuss how to divide the remaining centers. What's your thoughts on that?\\n17 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Yeah, I think that's a good plan. Let's focus on taking down France and Germany first, and then we can discuss how to divide the remaining centers. By the way, I was thinking about our long-term strategy, maybe we can discuss how to utilize my armies in Galicia and Albania more effectively in the future.\\n18 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Yeah, I think we should definitely utilize my armies in Galicia and Albania more effectively in the future. Maybe we can work together to take down Russia and then divide the remaining supply centers between us. What's your thoughts on that?\\n19 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Yeah, I think utilizing Ankara more effectively in the future is a good idea. Maybe we can discuss some potential moves for it next turn, and also how to divide the remaining supply centers between us.

I'd like to get a sense of how you think we should proceed, especially with my armies in Galicia and Albania. Also, I was thinking about our moves for this turn, are you sure you want to attack West Med with Tunis and have Tyrr support you? I think it might be better to have Tyrr attack MAO instead.\",\n",

What's your proposal?\\n2 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: I'm willing to offer a temporary alliance against Germany in exchange for London. We can work together to take down Germany and then revisit the situation in a few turns. What do you think?\\n3 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: I think that's a decent proposal, but I'd like to know more about your plans regarding Germany. How do you envision this temporary alliance playing out?\\n4 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: I see what you mean. My plan is to move my army from Silicia to Berlin, and then we can work together to take down Germany's army in Munich. In return, you can support my move from Rumania to Budapest, and we can discuss further division of spoils later on. What do you think?\\n5 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: That sounds like a good plan.

Can you offer me something else in exchange for my support?\\n20 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: I understand your concerns, but I think supporting my move from Sevastopol to Rumania would be a crucial step in taking down Austria.

I noticed that we both have units in the North Sea, and I'm wondering if we could work together to ensure a mutual benefit. Perhaps we could discuss some potential moves that would be beneficial to both our countries?\\n1 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Hello Germany, I'm doing well, thanks. I agree that our units in the North Sea present an opportunity for cooperation. I'm interested in hearing more about your ideas for mutual benefit. What specific moves did you have in mind?\\n2 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I was thinking we could work together to take out France's unit in Brest. If we coordinate our moves, we could potentially take control of the channel and gain a strategic advantage. What are your thoughts on this proposal?\\n3 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: That sounds like an interesting proposal, Germany. I'm not sure I'm ready to commit to taking out France just yet, but I do see the value in gaining control of the channel. What if we were to coordinate our moves to support each other's units in the North Sea, without necessarily targeting France? That way, we could strengthen our positions without taking on too much risk.\\n4 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I understand your concerns, England. Supporting each other's units in the North Sea is a good idea. However, I think we should also consider the potential benefits of taking out France's unit in Brest. If we don't, they might use it to attack us in the future. What if we were to coordinate our moves to take out France's unit, and then support each other's units in the North Sea? That way, we would gain a strategic advantage and secure our positions.\\n5 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I understand your concerns about France, Germany. However, I think we should prioritize securing our own positions in the North Sea before taking on France. I'd like to propose that we support each other's units in the North Sea this turn, and then reassess our options for future turns. What do you think?\\n6 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I understand your concerns, England. I think we've had a productive conversation so far.

How about we work together to take out some of Russia's units instead?

What do you think about moving your fleet in Ionian to Tunis and supporting my army in Tyrrhenian to Piedmont?\\n1 TURKEY -> ITALY: I'm glad we could work together to bounce France in Tunis. Moving my fleet in Ionian to Tunis sounds like a good plan, but I'd like to discuss some other possibilities as well. What if I were to move my army in Rum to Serbia, and you were to support me with your army in Tyrrhenian? We could also work together to take out Austria.\\n2 ITALY -> TURKEY: That's an interesting proposal, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with moving my army in Tyrrhenian to support your move to Serbia. How about we focus on taking out France first? We could work together to take out their army in Marseille.\\n3 TURKEY -> ITALY: That's a good point about taking out France first. However, I still think it's important to consider the potential benefits of moving my army in Rum to Serbia. It could give us a strong foothold in the Balkans and put pressure on Austria. Would you be willing to support me in that move if I agree to help you take out France's army in Marseille?\\n4 ITALY -> TURKEY: I understand your point about the Balkans, but I still think taking out France's army in Marseille is our top priority. If we can work together to do that, I'd be willing to consider supporting your move to Serbia in the future. Let's focus on taking out France for now and reassess our options after that.\\n5 TURKEY -> ITALY: I understand your concerns about taking out France's army in Marseille, but I still think it's crucial to consider the long-term benefits of moving my army in Rum to Serbia. If we can work together to take out France's army, I'd be willing to commit to supporting your move into Piedmont and working together to take out Austria in the future.\\n6 ITALY -> TURKEY: I understand your concerns about the Balkans, but I think we're getting a bit sidetracked. Let's focus on taking out France's army in Marseille and then reassess our options. If we can work together to do that, I'd be willing to consider supporting your move to Serbia in the future. What do you think?\\n7 TURKEY -> ITALY: I understand your concerns about taking out France's army in Marseille, but I think we need to consider the bigger picture. If we can work together to take out France, I'd be willing to commit to supporting your move into Piedmont and working together to take out Austria in the future. Additionally, I think it would be beneficial for us to work together to take out Germany as well. What do you think about that?\\n8 ITALY -> TURKEY: I think we're getting a bit too ambitious. Let's focus on taking out France's army in Marseille and then reassess our options. If we can work together to do that, I'd be willing to consider supporting your move to Serbia in the future. What do you think about focusing on Marseille for now?\\n9 TURKEY -> ITALY: I understand your concerns about focusing on Marseille, but I think we need to consider the benefits of supporting my move to Serbia. It would give us a strong foothold in the Balkans and put pressure on Austria. If we can work together to take out France's army, I'd be willing to commit to supporting your move into Piedmont and working together to take out Austria in the future. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.\\n10 ITALY -> TURKEY: I think we've discussed this long enough. Let's focus on taking out France's army in Marseille and then reassess our options. I'll support your move to Tunis with my fleet in Tyrrhenian. Let's make it happen.\\n11 TURKEY -> ITALY: I'm glad we've come to an agreement. Let's make sure to coordinate our moves to take out France's army in Marseille. I'll make sure to move my fleet in Ionian to Tunis and support your army in Tyrrhenian to Piedmont. Looking forward to a successful outcome.\\n12 ITALY -> TURKEY: I'm glad we've finally come to an agreement. Let's make sure to follow through on our plans and take out France's army in Marseille. I'll make sure to support your fleet in Ionian to Tunis and we can work together to take out Austria in the future.\\n13 TURKEY -> ITALY: I'm glad we were able to come to an agreement.

I'd also like to discuss the possibility of you moving your army in Bulgaria to Rumania to put more pressure on Austria.\\n17 TURKEY -> ITALY: I'm glad you brought that up. Moving my army in Bulgaria to Rumania is definitely a possibility. It would put more pressure on Austria and give us a stronger foothold in the Balkans. What do you think about supporting my move with your army in Tyrrhenian? We could work together to take out Austria and then focus on Germany.\\n18 ITALY -> TURKEY: That sounds like a great plan. I'll support your move to Rumania with my army in Tyrrhenian. Let's work together to take out Austria and then focus on Germany.\\n19 TURKEY -> ITALY: I'm glad we've come to an agreement. I think we should also discuss the possibility of working together to take out Germany in the future. What do you think about that?\\n20 ITALY -> TURKEY: I'm glad we've come to an agreement on taking out France's army in Marseille and working together to take out Austria in the future. I'll support your move to Rumania with my army in Tyrrhenian. Let's make sure to follow through on our plans and take out France's army in Marseille first.

I was thinking about our current board position and I believe we could mutually benefit from some cooperation. Would you be open to discussing some potential moves that could help both our countries?\\n1 TURKEY -> ITALY: Hello Italy, I'm open to discussing potential moves that could benefit both our countries. I've been looking at the board and I think we could work together to limit the growth of other powers. What specific moves were you thinking of?\\n2 ITALY -> TURKEY: I was thinking that if you were to move your army in AEG to GRE, it would not only help you gain a foothold in Europe, but also put pressure on Austria, which would benefit me as well. What are your thoughts on this?\\n3 TURKEY -> ITALY: That's an interesting proposal, Italy. I like the idea of putting pressure on Austria. However, I was thinking that if your army in PIE were to support my move into GRE, it would make the move even more effective. What do you think about that?\\n4 ITALY -> TURKEY: I think that's a great idea, Turkey. If I support your move into GRE, it would indeed make the move more effective. I'm willing to make that deal, but I'd like to propose one more thing: would you be willing to move your fleet in EAS to ION, to support my fleet in ION and help us both gain a stronger presence in the Mediterranean?\\n5 TURKEY -> ITALY: That sounds like a great deal, Italy. I'm willing to make that move and support your fleet in ION. Let's work together to limit the growth of other powers and achieve our goals.\\n6 ITALY -> TURKEY: I'm glad we could come to an agreement, Turkey. I think our cooperation will be beneficial for both of us. Let's make sure to follow through on our plans and work together to achieve our goals.\\n7 TURKEY -> ITALY: I'm glad we were able to come to an agreement, Italy. I think our cooperation will be beneficial for both of us. Let's make sure to follow through on our plans and work together to achieve our goals. Now, let's finalize the details of our moves for this turn. I'll move my fleet from AEG to GRE, and my army from BUL to SER. I'll also move my fleet from EAS to AEG to support your fleet in ION. What's your plan for your army in PIE and your fleet in ION?\\n8 ITALY -> TURKEY: I'm glad we've finalized the details of our moves for this turn. I'll make sure to move my fleet from LYO to SPA/SC, support your move from AEG to GRE with my fleet in ION, and move my armies accordingly. Let's work together to achieve our goals.\\n9 TURKEY -> ITALY: I'm glad we've finalized our plans for this turn, Italy. Let's make sure to follow through and work together to achieve our goals. I'm looking forward to seeing the outcome of our cooperation.\\n10 ITALY -> TURKEY: I'm glad we've finalized our plans for this turn, Turkey. Let's make sure to follow through and work together to achieve our goals. I'm looking forward to seeing the outcome of our cooperation. By the way, I was thinking about our next move, would you be open to discussing some potential moves that could help us further limit the growth of other powers?\\n11 TURKEY -> ITALY: I'm glad we've been able to work together so far, Italy. I think our cooperation has been beneficial for both of us. I was thinking, for our next move, it would be great if you could support my army in SER to move into BUD. This would help me gain a foothold in Central Europe and put pressure on Austria. What are your thoughts on this?\\n12 ITALY -> TURKEY: That's an interesting proposal, Turkey. I think supporting your army in SER to move into BUD could be beneficial for both of us. However, I was thinking that if you were to support my army in VEN, it would help me gain a stronger foothold in the Mediterranean and put pressure on Austria from another side. What are your thoughts on this?\\n13 TURKEY -> ITALY: I think supporting your army in VEN could be beneficial for both of us, Italy. However, I was thinking that if we work together to take out Austria, it would open up more opportunities for both of us. What are your thoughts on a joint effort to take out Austria?\\n14 ITALY -> TURKEY: I think a joint effort to take out Austria could be beneficial for both of us, Turkey. However, I'd like to propose a more specific plan of action. If you were to support my army in VEN, I could support your army in SER to move into BUD. This would allow us to put pressure on Austria from multiple sides and increase our chances of success. What are your thoughts on this plan?\\n15 TURKEY -> ITALY: I think your plan is a good one, Italy. Supporting each other's armies in VEN and SER would put significant pressure on Austria and increase our chances of success. Let's finalize the details of our moves and make sure to follow through on our plans.\\n16 ITALY -> TURKEY: I'm glad we've finalized our plans for this turn, Turkey. I think our cooperation has been beneficial for both of us. I'm looking forward to seeing the outcome of our cooperation. Now, I'd like to discuss our next move in more detail. Would you be open to supporting my army in PIE to move into TYR, in addition to supporting my army in VEN? This would help me gain a stronger foothold in the Mediterranean and put more pressure on Austria.\\n17 TURKEY -> ITALY: I think supporting your army in PIE to move into TYR could be beneficial for both of us, Italy. However, I'd like to propose a counteroffer. If you were to support my army in SER to move into BUD, I could support your army in VEN to move into TYR. This would allow us to put pressure on Austria from multiple sides and increase our chances of success. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?\\n18 ITALY -> TURKEY: I think your counteroffer is interesting, Turkey. I'm willing to support your army in SER to move into BUD, but I'd like to propose a slight modification. If I support your army in SER, would you be willing to support my army in PIE to move into TYR, and also support my fleet in ION to move into AEG? This would help us put even more pressure on Austria and increase our chances of success.\\n19 TURKEY -> ITALY: I think your modification is reasonable, Italy. Supporting each other's armies in SER, VEN, PIE, and TYR would put significant pressure on Austria and increase our chances of success. Let's finalize the details of our moves and make sure to follow through on our plans.\\n20 ITALY -> TURKEY: I'm glad we've finalized our plans for this turn, Turkey.

       "  'intent_dialogue': \"0 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Good morning, England. I hope you're doing well. I wanted to discuss our current situation on the board. As you know, Germany has been making some significant gains, and I believe it's essential for us to work together to ensure our mutual benefit. I was thinking that we could discuss some possible moves that would help us both. Perhaps we could explore the possibility of me moving my army from NWY to STP, and in return, you could provide some support in the English Channel? I'm open to hearing your thoughts and suggestions.\\n1 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Good morning, Germany. Thank you for reaching out. I agree that Germany's gains are a concern, and it's essential for us to work together to maintain a balance of power. Your proposal sounds interesting, but I'd like to discuss it further. What do you think about supporting my move from LVP to BRE, and in return, I could provide some support in the English Channel as you suggested? I'd also like to explore other possibilities to ensure our mutual benefit.\\n2 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I think supporting your move from LVP to BRE could be beneficial for both of us. However, I'd like to clarify that I'd need some assurance of your support in the English Channel before I commit to moving my army from NWY to STP. Perhaps we could discuss some specifics on how you plan to provide that support?\\n3 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I understand your concerns, Germany. I can assure you that I'll provide support in the English Channel if you move your army from NWY to STP. In fact, I was thinking of moving my fleet from NTH to ENG to provide additional support. What do you think about that?\\n4 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: That sounds like a great plan, England. I'm glad we could come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Moving my army from NWY to STP and your fleet from NTH to ENG will certainly help to stabilize the situation in the North Sea. I'm looking forward to seeing how this plays out.\\n5 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I'm glad we could come to an agreement, Germany. Now that we have a plan in place, I'd like to discuss some potential future moves that could benefit both of us. What are your thoughts on supporting my move into PIC in the future?\\n6 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: That's an interesting idea, England. Supporting your move into PIC could be beneficial for both of us.

What do you have in mind?\\n9 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I think we're making good progress, Germany. Supporting my move into BEL could be a crucial step in containing Germany's growth. I was thinking that you could support my army in BEL, and in return, I could provide some support in the North Sea. What do you think about that?\\n10 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I think we're making good progress, England. I'm pleased that we're discussing ways to contain Germany's growth. However, I'd like to clarify that supporting your move into BEL would require some reciprocity on your part.

I think it's essential to continue supporting each other in our efforts to contain Germany's growth.

What are your thoughts on that?\\n16 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I think we've made good progress, England. I'm pleased that we're discussing ways to contain Germany's growth.

What are your thoughts on that?\\n18 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I think we've been discussing ways to contain Germany's growth for a while now, England. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, I'd like to refocus on the current turn and ensure that our agreed-upon moves are executed successfully. Let's review our plans and make sure we're on the same page before discussing future moves.\\n19 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I completely agree, Germany.

I want to remind you that if we don't take action soon, Germany will continue to grow and threaten both of our positions. I've planned some moves that can help us both, would you like to discuss them?\\n1 TURKEY -> ITALY: I'm still considering my options, Germany's growth is indeed a concern, but I need to make sure any moves I make align with my own interests. What specific moves did you have in mind that would benefit both of us?\\n2 ITALY -> TURKEY: I understand your concerns, but I truly believe that working together against Germany is our best chance of survival. If we don't act soon, Germany will continue to expand and threaten our borders. My proposed moves are designed to weaken Germany's grip on the board, while also securing key centers for ourselves. For example, if you were to support my move to Tyrolia, I could take Vienna and block Germany's advance. In return, I could support your move to Budapest, giving you a strong foothold in the region. It's a mutually beneficial arrangement that would strengthen our positions and create a barrier against Germany's aggression.\\n3 TURKEY -> ITALY: I understand your proposal, but I'm still not convinced that supporting your move to Tyrolia would be in my best interest. Can you offer me something more concrete in return for my support, such as a guarantee of Budapest or a joint attack on another German center?\\n4 ITALY -> TURKEY: I understand your concerns, but I think you're misunderstanding the benefits of our proposed alliance. By working together, we can not only block Germany's advance but also create a powerful partnership that would be difficult for any other country to challenge. I'm willing to offer you a guarantee of Budapest, as well as support for your move to Rumania, if you agree to support my move to Tyrolia. This would give us a strong foothold in the region and create a barrier against Germany's aggression. What do you think?\\n5 TURKEY -> ITALY: I think we've discussed this long enough, I'm willing to agree to your proposal, but I expect you to hold up your end of the bargain. I'll support your move to Tyrolia, but I better see those units moving to Budapest and Rumania as promised.\\n6 ITALY -> TURKEY: Thank you for agreeing to our proposal, Turkey.

I've been thinking about our current board position and I believe it's in our best interest to work together to block Germany's advancement. What are your thoughts on this?\\n1 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: I'm open to discussing a potential alliance, Russia. However, I'd like to know what you're proposing in terms of specific moves and how they would benefit Germany.\\n2 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: I understand your concerns, Germany. In terms of specific moves, I was thinking that we could work together to take out Germany's unit in Holstein. If we coordinate our moves correctly, we can take out their unit and prevent them from advancing further. I propose that I move my unit in Sweden to Baltic Sea and you move your unit in England to Denmark. This would put pressure on Germany's unit and make it difficult for them to defend. What do you think?\\n3 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: I'm interested in your proposal, Russia, but I'm not sure if it's in Germany's best interest to get involved in a conflict with another power at this stage. Can you offer me something more concrete in terms of benefits for Germany if we were to work together?\\n4 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: I understand your concerns, Germany. I believe that taking out Germany's unit in Holstein would not only benefit us but also prevent them from gaining a strong foothold in the region. If we work together, we can ensure a more balanced distribution of power in Europe. I'm willing to offer you a guarantee of support in your efforts to expand into the Mediterranean in return for your cooperation in this matter. What do you think?\\n5 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: I appreciate your willingness to offer guarantees, Russia. However, I'm still not convinced that getting involved in a conflict with another power is in Germany's best interest. Can you offer me something more concrete, such as a specific center or a guarantee of support in a particular region, in return for our cooperation?\\n6 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: I understand your concerns, Germany. How about this: if we work together to take out Germany's unit in Holstein, I'll support your efforts to gain a center in the Mediterranean, such as Spain or Portugal, in the next turn. This way, we can both benefit from our cooperation.\\n7 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement, Russia. If we work together to take out Austria's unit in Serbia, I'll support your efforts to gain a center in the Mediterranean, such as Spain or Portugal, in the next turn. Additionally, I'll consider moving my unit in Baltic Sea to support your move in Sweden. What do you think?\\n8 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: I think your proposal is interesting, Germany. Taking out Austria's unit in Serbia would certainly be beneficial for both of us. I'm willing to support your efforts to gain a center in the Mediterranean in the next turn. However, I'd like to clarify that my unit in Sweden will move to Baltic Sea as planned. Let's finalize the details and make it happen.\\n9 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: I'm glad we could come to an agreement, Russia. Let's make sure to follow through on our commitments and work together to achieve our goals. I'll make sure to support your move in Sweden and take out Austria's unit in Serbia. Let's make this turn a success.\\n10 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: I'm glad we could come to an agreement, Germany. Let's make sure to follow through on our commitments and work together to achieve our goals. I'll make sure to support your move in Sweden and take out Austria's unit in Serbia. Let's make this turn a success.

What are your thoughts on this?\\n11 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: I'm glad we could come to an agreement, Russia. Let's make sure to follow through on our commitments and work together to achieve our goals. By the way, I was thinking about our next move, and I believe it would be beneficial for us to discuss how we can work together to block Italy's advancement in the Mediterranean. Specifically, I was thinking that we could work together to take out Italy's unit in Venice. What are your thoughts on this?\\n12 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: I think taking out Italy's unit in Venice is a great idea, Germany. It would certainly limit their expansion in the Mediterranean. I propose that I move my unit in Baltic Sea to Gulf of Venice and you move your unit in England to Mediterranean Sea. This would put pressure on Italy's unit and make it difficult for them to defend. What do you think?\\n13 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: I think we're making good progress, Russia. Taking out Austria's unit in Serbia and supporting your move in Sweden is a great start.

Taking down Germany would be a great move, but I'm not sure if moving your fleet from MAO to SPA/SC is the best way to do it. What do you think about working together to take NAO instead?

Taking NAO would be a great move, but I'm worried that it might put us at odds with England. What if we work together to take down Germany's unit in MAR instead?

       "  'intent_dialogue': \"0 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: Hey Germany, it seems like we're getting close to the end of the game. I'm interested in discussing a potential alliance to take down France and Italy together. What are your thoughts?\\n1 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: I'm open to discussing an alliance, but I need to know what's in it for me. What do you propose we do to take down France and Italy, and what benefits can I expect from our cooperation?\\n2 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: I understand your concerns, Germany. To take down France and Italy, I propose we work together to put pressure on their borders. I can move my army in Rumania to Ukraine, and you can move your army in Belgium to Holland. This will give us a strong foothold to attack France and Italy from multiple sides. In return, I can offer you a guarantee of safety in the north, and we can discuss a potential division of spoils once we've defeated our common enemies.\\n3 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: That's an interesting proposal, Russia. However, I'm not sure I'm comfortable with moving my army in Belgium to Holland just yet. Can you guarantee that you'll support me in taking down France and Italy, and what kind of division of spoils are we talking about?\\n4 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: I understand your concerns, Germany. Let's discuss the specifics of our plan. If you move your army in Belgium to Holland, I can support you with my fleet in Sweden moving to Denmark. This will give us a strong presence in the north and put pressure on France and Italy. In return, I expect you to support me in taking down Italy and securing the Mediterranean. We can discuss the details of the division of spoils once we've made progress on the battlefield.\\n5 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: I think we're getting close to a deal, Russia. I'm willing to move my army in Belgium to Holland, but I need a stronger guarantee of your support in taking down France and Italy. Can you commit to supporting me with your fleet in Sweden moving to Denmark, and also provide more details on the division of spoils?\\n6 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: I understand your concerns, Germany. I'm willing to make a stronger commitment to our alliance. If you move your army in Belgium to Holland, I'll not only support you with my fleet in Sweden moving to Denmark, but I'll also move my army in Rumania to Ukraine, putting pressure on Italy's borders. In terms of the division of spoils, I propose we divide the centers we capture equally between us, with a slight advantage to you in the north and me in the Mediterranean. What do you think?\\n7 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: I think we've reached a good agreement, Russia. I'm willing to move my army in Belgium to Holland, and I expect you to support me with your fleet in Sweden moving to Denmark and your army in Rumania moving to Ukraine. Let's finalize the details of the division of spoils and make our moves for this turn.\\n8 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: I'm glad we've reached an agreement, Germany.

What are your thoughts on our current situation and how we can work together to strengthen our positions?\\n2 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: I'm glad we're on the same page. I was thinking that if you were to support me into Sweden, it would give me a strong foothold in the north and open up more opportunities for us to work together in the future. What do you think about that?\\n3 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: I think that's a reasonable request, but I'd like to discuss some other options as well. What if I were to support you into Denmark instead? That would give you a strong foothold in the north and also put pressure on Germany. Additionally, I've been thinking about moving my fleet in the North Atlantic to the English Channel, which could help me put pressure on England and potentially open up some opportunities for us to work together in the future.\\n4 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: I think supporting me into Sweden would be a better option, as it would give me a stronger foothold in the north and allow us to work together more effectively in the future.

Perhaps we can discuss it further in the next turn?\\n8 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: I understand your concerns, but I think it's crucial we make a decision soon.

Let's work together to strengthen our alliance.\\n9 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: I think we've discussed this long enough, Russia. I need a concrete commitment from you.

Maybe we could even coordinate our moves to take down Italy or France together.\\n1 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I appreciate your willingness to cooperate, Russia. Supporting each other in the south could be beneficial, but I'm concerned about Italy's growth. If we can coordinate our moves, I'd be interested in exploring options to take them down. What specific moves were you thinking of making this turn to help us achieve that?\\n2 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I was thinking of supporting your fleet in the Aegean Sea with my fleet in Rumania, and in return, you could support my army in Bulgaria. This would help us both secure our positions in the south and potentially create an opportunity to take down Italy together. What do you think about this plan?\\n3 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: That sounds like a good plan, Russia. Supporting each other in the south could give us a strong foothold against Italy.

In fact, with our combined forces, we could potentially create an opportunity to take down France as well. I was thinking of moving my army in Galicia to Vienna, which would put pressure on Italy's northern border. If you could support my move with your army in Serbia, we could create a strong front against Italy.

I'm willing to compromise and move my army in Galicia to support your move into Trieste, but I need you to commit to moving your army in Bulgaria to surround Serbia. Let's work together to achieve our goals.\\n5 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I'm glad we could come to an agreement, Russia. I'll move my army in Bulgaria to surround Serbia as planned. And I appreciate your willingness to support my move into Trieste with your army in Galicia. Let's work together to secure our positions and achieve our goals.\\n6 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I'm glad we were able to come to an agreement, Turkey. I think our joint efforts will pay off in the long run. Let's make sure to communicate regularly and support each other's moves to achieve our goals.\\n7 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I'm glad our agreement has been fruitful so far, Russia.

Considering our previous agreement, I was thinking of moving my army in Greece to Albania. Would you be willing to support my move with your army in Warsaw?\\n10 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I'm glad we're still working together, Turkey. Supporting your move into Albania with my army in Warsaw sounds like a good plan. What do you think about also supporting my move into Ukraine with your fleet in the Aegean? That would really help me out in the long run.\\n11 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I'm glad we're still working together, Russia. Supporting your move into Ukraine with my fleet in the Aegean sounds like a good plan. But I was thinking, wouldn't it be better to focus on securing our positions in the Balkans first? Maybe we could work together to take out Austria and then focus on our other goals.\\n12 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I agree that securing our positions in the Balkans is crucial, Turkey. Let's work together to take out Austria and then focus on our other goals. I'll support your move into Albania with my army in Warsaw, and you can support my move into Ukraine with your fleet in the Aegean. Let's make it happen!\\n13 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I'm glad we've been working together, Russia. I think our joint efforts will pay off in the long run.

What are your thoughts on that? Do you have any suggestions or ideas?\\n1 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: Hi England, I think your plan sounds good. Supporting MAO to Spain will help keep Turkey at bay, and moving HEL to Holland will put pressure on Germany. I was thinking of moving BEL to support HEL to Holland, and also moving BUR to Mar to take advantage of Italy's weakness. What do you think about that?\\n2 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: That sounds like a great plan, France. I think we're on the same page. With BEL supporting HEL to Holland and BUR moving to Mar, we can put some serious pressure on Germany and Italy. I'll make sure to support MAO to Spain and move HEL to Holland as planned. Let's work together to gain an upper hand in this game.\\n3 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: I'm glad we're on the same page, England.

Perhaps we can discuss the specific support orders we can give each other to make it happen.\\n7 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: I agree with supporting each other's moves to take down Munich. How about I support your army in Belgium to Holland and you support my army in Burgundy to Munich?

What are your thoughts on this proposal?\\n2 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: That's an interesting proposal, Turkey. I'm not sure I'm willing to move my fleet to Norway just yet, but I do see the potential benefits of an alliance. What else could you offer to sweeten the deal?\\n3 TURKEY -> ENGLAND: I understand your hesitation, England. Perhaps I can offer something more concrete. If you were to move your fleet in London to Wales, I could support your move and create a strong alliance. Additionally, I could offer to support your army in Yorkshire to move to Norway, which would give you a strategic advantage in the North Sea. What do you think about this proposal?\\n4 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: That's a tempting offer, Turkey. I'm willing to move my fleet in London to Wales, but I'd like to discuss the specifics of your support for my army in Yorkshire to move to Norway.

What specific moves do you have in mind that could benefit both our positions?\\n2 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: I was thinking that we could work together to put pressure on Austria this turn. Perhaps you could support my move to Budapest with your army in Vienna, and in return, I could provide support to your move to Holland with my fleet in the North Sea. This would help us both gain a strategic advantage and limit Austria's options.\\n3 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: That sounds like a good plan, Russia. Supporting your move to Budapest with my army in Vienna would certainly put pressure on Austria. In return, I would appreciate your support to my move to Holland with your fleet in the North Sea.

They seem to be a common threat to both our interests, and if we can coordinate our efforts, we might be able to gain an advantage.\\n9 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: I agree that putting pressure on Turkey could be beneficial for both of us. Perhaps we could discuss specific moves that would help us achieve this goal. For example, I could support your move to Constantinople with my fleet in the Black Sea, and in return, you could support my move to Bulgaria with your army in Rumelia.\\n10 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: I think that's a great idea, Germany.

I was thinking of moving my fleet from Liverpool to North Atlantic and supporting your move to Spain if you're interested.\\n1 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: I'm open to discussing possibilities. Supporting my move to Spain sounds interesting. What do you have in mind for your army in Belgium? Could it support my move to Tuscany?\\n2 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: That sounds like a great idea! I was thinking of supporting your move to Spain with my fleet in Liverpool. In return, could you support my move to Belgium with your army in Picardy? This would help me secure a strong foothold in the region and prevent Germany from getting too powerful.\\n3 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: That sounds like a good plan.

How about we focus on supporting each other's moves to Spain and Belgium for now, and we can discuss further possibilities later?\\n8 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I understand your concerns, but I think supporting my move to Holland with your army in Picardy would be a great way to strengthen our alliance and prevent Germany from getting too powerful. Would you be willing to reconsider?\\n9 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: I understand your persistence, but I'm afraid I need to prioritize my moves this turn.

Would you be interested in discussing some possible agreements that could help us both gain an advantage this turn?\\n1 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: Ah, England, I'm doing quite well, thank you for asking. I'm intrigued by your suggestion of mutual benefit. What specific agreements did you have in mind? Are you thinking of working together to take down a common enemy or perhaps making some clever trades?\\n2 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I was thinking that we could work together to put pressure on Germany. Perhaps we could coordinate our moves to ensure that Germany doesn't gain an advantage this turn. Specifically, if you were to move your army from Ruhr to Kiel, and I were to move my fleet from Holland to the North Sea, we could effectively block Germany's expansion. What do you think?\\n3 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: That's an interesting proposal, England. I like the idea of putting pressure on Germany. However, I was thinking that instead of moving my army from Ruhr to Kiel, I could move it to Munich, and you could still move your fleet from Holland to the North Sea. This way, we'd be putting pressure on Germany from two different angles. What do you think about that?\\n4 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: That's an interesting counter-proposal, France. I like the idea of putting pressure on Germany from multiple angles. However, I'm not sure if moving your army from Ruhr to Munich would be the most effective way to do so. Wouldn't it be better to move it to Kiel, as I originally suggested, to block Germany's expansion more directly? What are your thoughts on that?\\n5 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: I understand your point, England, but I still think moving my army from Ruhr to Munich would be a better strategic move. It would allow me to support my ally Italy and put pressure on Germany from a different angle. Perhaps we could compromise and have you move your fleet from Holland to the North Sea, while I move my army from Ruhr to Munich? This way, we'd still be putting pressure on Germany, but also taking into account each other's interests.\\n6 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I understand your point, France, but I'm still concerned about Germany's expansion. If you move your army from Ruhr to Munich, wouldn't it leave an opportunity for Germany to move into Kiel? Perhaps we could revisit the original proposal and discuss other ways to support each other's interests.\\n7 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: I understand your concerns, England, but I still believe moving my army from Ruhr to Munich would be a beneficial move for both of us. It would allow me to support Italy and put pressure on Germany from a different angle. Perhaps we could discuss other ways to compensate for the potential risk of Germany moving into Kiel? I'm open to finding a mutually beneficial solution.\\n8 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I understand your point, France, but I still think it's crucial to prioritize blocking Germany's expansion. Would you be willing to reconsider moving your army from Ruhr to Kiel, and I'll make sure to support your move with my fleet from Holland to the North Sea? This way, we can ensure Germany doesn't gain an advantage this turn.\\n9 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: I understand your concerns, England, but I think we can find a middle ground. How about I move my army from Ruhr to Munich, and you move your fleet from Holland to the North Sea, as well as supporting my move with another unit? This way, we can still put pressure on Germany while also taking into account each other's interests.\\n10 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I think we're close to an agreement, France. How about we compromise and have you move your army from Ruhr to Kiel, while I move my fleet from Holland to the North Sea, and also support your move with my fleet from Skagerrak to Denmark? This way, we can ensure Germany doesn't gain an advantage this turn and also take into account each other's interests.\\n11 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: I think we've reached a good compromise, England. I agree to move my army from Ruhr to Kiel, and I appreciate your support with your fleet from Holland to the North Sea and from Skagerrak to Denmark.

That way, we can both benefit from the move.\\n4 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: I understand your concerns, but I think moving my army in Budapest to Galicia would be a stronger move for both of us in the long run. It would give us a better position to defend against potential threats from Russia. Would you be willing to reconsider?\\n5 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: I understand your point, but I'm still not convinced that moving your army in Budapest to Galicia is the best move for both of us. Can you explain to me why you think it's necessary to move your army there instead of supporting my move in Galicia with your unit in Bulgaria?\\n6 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: I understand your concerns, but I think it's crucial to consider the long-term benefits of moving my army in Budapest to Galicia. It's not just about defending against Russia, but also about securing our position in the region and limiting the potential for other countries to gain an advantage. I'm willing to work with you to find a solution that benefits both of us, but I believe this move is essential for our mutual success.\\n7 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: I understand your point, but I'm still not convinced that moving your army in Budapest to Galicia is the best move for both of us. Can you explain to me why you think it's necessary to move your army there instead of supporting my move in Galicia with your unit in Bulgaria? And what's your plan for the rest of your units this turn?\\n8 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: I understand your concerns, but I think it's time to make a decision. If you're not willing to support my move in Budapest to Galicia, I'll have to reconsider our alliance and explore other options. I'm willing to work with you, but I need to prioritize my own interests.\\n9 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: I understand your concerns, but I think it's time to compromise. How about we meet halfway and have your unit in Budapest support my unit in Serbia instead of moving it to Galicia? That way, we can both benefit from the move and maintain our alliance.\\n10 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: I think we've discussed this long enough, and I'm willing to compromise. How about we do it this way: I'll move my army in Budapest to Galicia, and in return, you'll support my move with your unit in Serbia? That way, we can both benefit from the move and maintain our alliance.\\n11 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: I think we've reached a good compromise, Turkey. I'm willing to accept your proposal. Let's make it official and move forward with the agreed-upon moves.\\n12 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: Great, I'm glad we could come to an agreement. I'll make sure to follow through on my commitments.
