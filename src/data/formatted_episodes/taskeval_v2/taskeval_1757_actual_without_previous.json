As you can see I have stabbed Austria, seeing as he wasn't helping me much anyway! ~N~ Obviously as things stand you are missing bits of your homeland to both me and to Austria. I just want you to know that I would like to offer again (genuinely this time) the hand of friendship. You would make a much more practical ally for me because you will soon be able to strike against the main threat in this game, France. I know me and France are on the same number of supply centres, but at the moment he has Italy as an ally and only tiny fragments of Germany and England resisting him - I currently have no allies and Russia, Austria and Italy all out to get me! ~N~ So I'm hoping I can do a deal with you to balance things up again. ~N~ So my proposal is: this turn, Moscow support Sev > Ukr, and next turn my Ukr will support Liv > War, and Moscow can move into Sev. Austria won't expect us to ally (particularly if you pretend to ally with him!), and by the next build you will have all your home Sc's back. ~N~ Basically I need your help (Italy is my back-up plan but he's allied with France), otherwise I'm out of this game. And if we work together - either one of us could win. I hope by giving up Sev as a gesture of good faith I can convince you that I mean business. ~N~ Thanks for listening!\r\n1 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I was going to propose you something like that. try to have Austria moving away with GAL so its one less support to take in consideration. ~N~ Also propose him to attack me or something, so you're sure to take UKR.\r\n2 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I'm not sure he'll believe anything I say any more! And he might disband Gal or Ukr in any event. But if they're both still there you might suggest he attacks Rumania with Gal and supports you into Sevastopol with Ukr (I'm sure you can sell it!). You probably won't get Warsaw back this turn with 2 but if you get me into Ukraine to support you, we should get Warsaw back to you before the build. You can choose whether to risk taking it with 2 and take Sevastopol or to make certain of Warsaw with 3 and trust me to let you have Sevastopol next time round - I certainly wouldn't mind having the extra unit for an extra turn!\r\n3 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: Well it seems Turkey has decided to turn on me, if you want help re-taking Sevastopol then i am happy to assist. ~N~ 03:15 PM mhmm, I can support you in SEV and you give me back WAR?\r\n4 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: This is what we exchanged.

Then we call a 4-way truce and start a new game.\r\n5 TURKEY -> GERMANY: I guess that's very true.

From there we still can't get TUN, so next move is to hit GULF which can then break support or threaten MARS. Your thoughts?\r\n1 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: My moves if you agree,\nPIE hold\nVEN support PIE\nTYR support MUN\nBOH support MUN\nSIL support BER\nTUS to Gulf\nROM support NAP to TYR Sea (can also move from ROM or ION sea to TYR sea depending on which you think is best. Im not fussed about losing a centre. There is an advantage of moving ION sea to TYR because sets up a possible convoy and hit on TUN with your Greek army). Thoughts?\r\n2 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: I do not need the center from Naples, honestly. However, the plus side of having the fleet from ION in TYR would be a 4 fleet front against France's 3.

Lets go with ionan sea to tyr sea.\nYe ive been thinking on germany but cant see much advantage. He will hit kiel this move. Our best hope is the fleets in sth. If england builds will take a few turns for them to get another fleet down there and we will shortly dislodge tyr sea ie they will only have two fleets. We can then use that advantage to hit gulf, west med, tunis. Thats my thoughts anyway.\r\n",

Plus, with Russia's help he can try for Syria without exposing Con or Smyrna.\r\n1 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Well, let's think about this.\n\nTurkey cannot cover both Syria and hold Constantinople even with Russia help actually - look.\n\nIf Turkey moves Smyrna to Syria, and orders Ankara to Smyrna with Con supporting, with Black Sea supporting Con, then both Con and Smyrna become vulnerable - a simple move of Bul to Con, Aegean supports east Med to Smyrna would ensure a gain of Smyrna\n\nIf Turkey decides to hold tight and stay put, that leaves the convoy to Syria open to be done. Obviously we can't do both, but I wonder whether it would be worth trying for Smyrna?\r\n2 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Hmm, true about protecting them all. And PB may be a player to try covering Syria over taking the safer route for the immediate future. If you do try for Smyrna there's a chance you could lose Con, though in that case you'll have gained Smyrna, so we're probably still better off over all.\r\n3 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Your call really.

If you want to screw me over bel, you can, but don't pretend it was anything having to do with an alliance anyting else. I can't trust you. that's too bad. You let England off the hook and you cost yourself an ally. When you got bel was still up inthe air. [1179252] to build another fleet. Such is dip lirfe. Good luck to you though.\r\n2 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I'm sorry that you feel that way. No it certainly wasn't according to any alliance as we hadn't been behaving like allies until that point. I'm very trusting of my allies and generally leave my borders open to them. What I was seeing from you though set my radar off. Again it was a move because of maybe.\n\nStill though, you admit that your intention was to build another fleet. That is pretty much an admission that you intended to keep Belgium for long enough to keep youself from losing that additional fleet. As it stand though, the new fleet is blue and I'm willing to work with you on how it's to be deployed.\n\nI'm not really bantering over the morality of the issue. If we were being truly moral the Belgians would rule Belgium and the Dutch, [1413210], Portuge', and [215948] would be autonomous too. Certainly, I was able to take Belgium and I did. A point that I was up front with you about. When the roles were reversed you did the same. Belgium originally belonged to the Belgians did it not? If anything, you've seen that I will be honest about my intentions even in a situation in which it would be easier to lie.\r\n3 FRANCE -> GERMANY: You should really be looking at Warsaw and Moscow. I'm sure that you're as surprised as I am that at least one of those builds wasn't a fleet on the North Coast of St. Pete.\n\nI think our problem is that our playing styles are very similar and we're both used to other people seeing that our ideas have merit and going along with them. Hence we're butting heads when we'd be better served by turning our attention elsewhere.\n\nIf you are willing to set a plan that shows equal growth for both of our nations then I'm your guy. If you insist on a junior partner, then it's going to be a frustrating game for both of us.\n\nThat being said, We are in great position to split England. I get Liverpool and you get London and Edinburg. I get control of the seas though. No more than the two German fleets already in existence. What do you say? It beats Russia getting Edinburgh, and it leaves us both at seven. We'd then be able to mount an assault on Russia. Me from the north and you from the midlands.\r\n4 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Well, there's nothing I can do except accept what's real. So, I agree with your offer. We split Eng 2-1 and even out. No benefit to fighting and lots to working together. What do you want to do?\r\n",

        "intent_dialogue": "0 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: Well, I'm not saying that it's a rational plan by Italy, but what other hypothesis would better explain his tactics and diplomacy from last season.\n\nMy guess is that he is a bit dissatisfied settling for the 3-way draw and is looking to establish a chance to either solo or at least remove me from the game.\n\nI think he was hoping that I would have made an aggressive move on you, leaving myself more exposed for a stab that he was trying to line up for the fall. He was acting all paranoid about you and was trying awfully hard to convince me that you would attempt to solo, how [659259] all might try to help you solo, and all that nonsense. He was even trying to persuade me to move into Finland. I imagine that he tried to persuade the opposite (that I would try to enter Finland) to you?\r\n1 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: So, Italy is still telling me that his only interests with his past and future moves are to prevent you from soloing and to establish the 3-way draw. Frankly, I don't really believe that. I think his Spring moves were intended to set up for an opportunistic stab, should he elect to follow through this fall with the intent to remove me from the game for either a solo attempt or to work toward a 2-way. He &might& be thinking of backing out of that plan now, since perhaps I didn't leave myself as wide open as he expected I might, but I really can't be too sure of his intent. His forced move on Bulgaria was perhaps intended to destroy that army (if I had self-bounced in Ser), and he was perhaps hoping that I would have overextended away from Trieste leaving that home SC open to be snatched by Tyrolia and Venice.\n\nThis fall, Italy will either follow through with the stab or he won't.\n\nHopefully, he'll abandon the stab, backing out of Bulgaria and moving away from my Scs. That would allow the two of us to set up and hold one of several stalemate lines that would insure that we keep 17 Scs and force the 3-way draw.\n\nHowever, if Italy continues with the stab, it can only be with the intent to see me out of the game through either an Italian solo or 2-way IG draw. If that is what he chooses, I would do everything I can to throw the solo to you. So, to prepare for that contingency, I would like you to take Stp and Warsaw away from me this fall, and to also attack Tyrolia from Munich. If Italy doesn't stab me, we would still be in position to ensure the stalemate. However, if Italy does stab me and tries to press for the solo, I want you to be in position to capitalize on me throwing the solo to you.\n\nI am doing this on a matter of principle. I've done my best to explain this situation to Italy. So, if Italy is stupid enough to throw away an easy 3-way draw position for the insane ambition of attempting a solo at my expense, he needs to be punished with a German solo. Even if his moves is actually the result of some incredible manipulation on your part, possibly including the promise of giving him a 2-way draw, he still needs to be punished with seeing you solo, and intend to ensure that this game won't end in a two-way draw.\n\nWell, I really hope that it doesn't have to come down to this contingency, but I just wanted to let you know what I am prepared to do.\r\n2 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: i can certainly assure you that I don't believe in [1410949] draws. and i have not had any conversation with italy regarding that. my take is that he wants to try for a solo himself, or as you said, set himself up for the attempt.\n\nI feel hesitant to try to take war from you. are you sure you want me to try to do that? i can take stp and i can hit tyrolia, but I am really not interested in being in such a position that then I become the solo threat and end up helping italy get into the atlantic in some fashion.\n\nI have told him very clearly that if he goes to MAO, that I will do all in my power to stop him as well and will consider us at war. so hopefully we have both given him a strong enough message that he does not make such an attempt.\n\nbut suffice to say that if he does continue down this path, I'll be there to back you up 100% and will help in any way I can.\r\n",

He is so much larger he could basically take what he wants from me.\n\nIn addition, he's stabbed you before, and is highly likely to do so again. Be under no illusion that if and when my threat is neutralised he will turn right around and gobble you up. In your position as you were last turn you were basically secure; he couldn't defeat you without another fleet bordering Smyr, which I would have easily stopped. Now you're much more vulnerable.\n\nI'd love it if you could reconsider your decision and join our side. England, France and I are already working together as I'm sure you've deduced, and we're set to win the fight quite easily at the moment. Our alliance was formed to stop the Austria-germany alliance, and as such our current agreement is a three way draw. We would be very willing to open that to a four way on the same understanding. As for your possible SC gains, Bulgaria, Greece, Rumania and Sevastopol would be obvious locations for Turkish occupation. Let me know your thoughts.\r\n1 TURKEY -> ITALY: I was hoping to speak to you actually. Austria has betrayed me twice, and now it is my turn to betray them. I have given the illusion that we are in am alliance, but I only said that so.he would free up units from around me.

Tell me what you need me to do and I would love to end in a draw with the three of you.\r\n2 ITALY -> TURKEY: Excellent. Well obviously at the moment I need you to prove your intentions so I'll leave that to you, but might I suggest slipping Aeg into Bul and Eastern to Aeg?

But you'd agreed to give him mars anyway, so he has managed to take the first step without comitting to any side.\nBut if Italy wants a draw, he will try to secure Mars and Iberia and seal it off from you, to make a solo really hard. So I am somewhat worried about Italy stabbing me.

I am mistrustful of both my partners over on the east side as they are quite close and I made a promis to you to retreat which I have kept and am planning on keeping. but i'm not hearing or seeing you move against either italy or engalnd... so what am I to think about your intent?\n\nlet me know what you'd like to see happen and what you think would be a valid offer and we can go from there...\r\n2 GERMANY -> FRANCE: well, here is what I know so far. England is not going to go for por. that is my understanding - my guess is he'll move MAO to Ech and NAO to Nwg to come at me. which means you could theoretically take mar on your own if you chose to. as for me... i'm not sure yet... i might need to convoy into the english mainland.\r\n3 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I am not in a position to move 'against' anybody as of now.

You know as well as I do that alliances in league play is a slightly different dynamic. ~N~ ~N~ I still have two fleets with which to help you in the Med. You have four armies staring at three wide open Russian Sc's. Your expansion west will be halted shortly and worse, you are already getting bottled up leaving very little room for more builds. ~N~ ~N~ You need to expand eastward or you will eventually be destroyed. You are too far along into this game without enough Sc's to get much further. ~N~ ~N~ France and England will defeat you unless you do something about it. ~N~ ~N~ Russia will stay the same as he will lose Sweden but gain Ank. He's a lame duck. I still have enough power to fight France with you. You get nothing from Russia other than a secure Eastern flank. But it does you no good right now. ~N~ ~N~ :)\r\n1 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: huh...Russia missed his turn...how very lame duckish of him...wouldn't you say? ;) ~N~ ~N~ So...c'mon...France and England are &dominating& and the best thing you can do is side with a lame duck?! :) You are better than that! A slight, but with all due respect, jab...don't get me wrong, I realize you are doing what's best...but then again, so am I. I just hope you can appreciate it...as you might this: ~N~ ~N~ \"Stephen: &to [772095] [1171655]& God tells me he can get me out of this mess, but he's pretty sure your fucked.\" ~N~ ~N~ =D ~N~ ~N~ What will you rely on Russia to do now?\r\n2 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: hah yes I like that... and I am concerned with England/France. The problem at the moment is that England will be beat me to Modcow if I stabbed and the Russian fleet in the Black Sea will take an age to destroy and by then Italy will have succumbed to France.\r\n3 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: \"I think that this turn is absolutely crucial and will dictate future shape of the region.\" ~N~ ~N~ That's as correct now as it was when you said it last year.\r\n4 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: don't mind that last post then...just flinging more ammo. =D\r\n5 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: Good points...the only other option is to tell Russia to call off his attack on me. lol...yeah, I said it! ~N~ ~N~ But at this point, what's the inevitable result? Can you see that far ahead accurately? I don't know if I can...but so far, it seems like the only way to survive an Entente Cordiale is for US three to band together. ~N~ ~N~ If you take me out...aren't you just sealing your fate?\r\n",

You can assure that you do not lose any unit, by tapping all his supporting units. Tun-ion, Nap-apu and Tyr-tri assure Austria can't take Nap or Ven. Only risk then is Rom, but I'd probably assure you would cover that if I were Austria.\n\nAnd if you do that, you can have Ven support Tyr-tri, and who knows take Tri if you have Russia's cooperation.\n\nNo need to tell me anything on what you decide to do.

That'd be hard to block.\n\nThe rest is pretty easy.\n\nTurkey is going to be a HUGE problem with so many free builds.

Germany has 4 units next to Burgundy, so my army being there couldn't have prevented him from taking it, , and I may have been forced to disband a unit in Spring, which would guarantee me a SC loss in Autumn. Im still very much interested in working with you, the sooner the better, because Germany is the biggest long term threat, whatever short term deals he may offer to any of us.\r\n3 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: Okay. Well I'm not hearing much from Germany. Either he's really busy as he claims, or I was right and he's setting himself up to change the tides again.\nI will do my best to secure NTH this year. That is my main objective. It should also tell you that you don't have to fear England's fleets for a while at least. Given the first few years, I think it wise to take it one step at a time.\nLet me know if you meet with any success where Italy is concerned. Austria's role in this game could also change if Italy was convinced to play otherwise than with Germany.\r\n4 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: Yeah, I'll definitely keep you informed, both on Italy and otherwise. As of now, Italy seems to agree that Germany should be stopped, and had agreed to help me if I let him take Mars. I will probably support him into Mars this turn, with Gas, while using MAO to cover Spain (that's why i needed to destroy the Bur army).\nOf course, you'd told me that Germany was going to give Mars to Italy anyway, so Italy will actually get to make a neutral move, and potentially side with either of me and Germany in the next move.\r\n",

Also this stab wasn't exactly the decisive fatal blow that one hopes to achieve with a stab. While I can see that you might be able to come out of this with the upper hand it won't necessarily be easy.\nI am pragmatic though. If you change your mind let me know. I could have been a great ally for you, and another opportunity for you stab me would have arisen.\r\n1 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: ... as in the final stab before the win (assuming we hadn't decided to go 17/17)\r\n2 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: Hello. I'm very sorry for not responding earlier. Haven't been able to check the game in more than a day. I also need to apologize for the stab and, before I start explaining why I did it and what I would like to offer now, I'd like to say I'm very keen on trying to keep the alliance with you.\n\nSo, first, some explanations on why I attacked you after you being a great ally, even letting me in the BS.\n1. I am very much scared of you and Italy splitting me once Austria is gone.\n2. I had promised you to move out of BS, which effectively made this spring turn the perfect moment for you to attack me. Taking BUD from GAL and moving in BS behind me would have placed you in a perfect position and I already have Italy quite willing to fight me. I have three fleets after all.\n3. I guess I was tempted to find a way to keep some positional advantage over you for the time-being, as the risk of going to war now seemed less scary than the risk of you going to war with me if I start looking like an easy target.\n4. Once I decided to go for the stab and thinking about what will happen after, I realized there's a good chance I may be able to offer a reasonable deal to you. Plus, everyone else being convinced we're at war is not such a bad thing.\r\n3 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: So, here's what I can suggest, I'm open to other ideas also.\n1.

What should we do to to make sure we're ok longer-term? Tell me how you see the game in general.\n\nI also have one unit in MOS I'm not sure what to use for? I am hoping neither you nor GER will move against me, I have no such plans of my own, which makes it somewhat idle.\r\n2 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I'm typically always worried about everything, which can also make me numb to it all, ironically. Also, you said you'd be my game-long ally, perhaps I put too much faith in that? I want to kill the Turk and thought we could double-team the German sometime soon, but sounds like you may not want that? What do you want to do once the Turk is crippled, we have to shift our attention somewhere? I thought you might shift Mos north to help with Scandinavia, but keeping Mos put as a defender also makes sense so you can sit back and watch how things play out for a season oe two without moving towards someone and \"picking a fight.\"\r\n",

You should conquer Russia and Germany quickly, so you can reach the 3 way draw.\nTo tell the truth I'm a little bit afraid that you plan to stab Austria. That way you would get into a similar good position as France has now. Because of this I plan to help a little bit France. I think if you afraid more from a France solo, it is less likely that you turns against Austria.\nOf course when I will see you can't stop France without me, I will turn against him, of course only then if I would still have any unit then. :)))\r\n1 TURKEY -> ENGLAND: You believe him when he promised to support you into Holland, then? Well, you never know. It may be true. Sadly I'm in no position to offer an alternative, so you must of course do whatever may help you survive in the immediate future.\n\nIf you manage to pull it off I'll look forward to working with you :)\r\n2 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: No-no, he asked me to support him into Hol. I will do that now. I know that it is a dangerous movement, but I think I need to make the 3 way draw closer. For this we should eliminate Russia and Germany. I hope he won't take Lon and this way I will have one more turn to make him weaker if something turns wrong.\nSurvival means for me nothing, I'm playing here to help reach the draw.\r\n3 TURKEY -> ENGLAND: The question one has to ask yourself is why wouldn't he take London? Why risk a random element such as yourself when it can be so easily replaced with a French unit under complete control?\n\nI'm not one to tell others what to do, but I have to admit that in your shoes I'd have been more tempted to ask for German support to Denmark. He's desperate enough to need you, and it puts your unit closer to a potential stalemate line position.\n\nStill, time will tell. Good luck!\r\n",

I've been playing this game awfully (thanks for being so polite as to merely call it \"weird\") and for a long time.\nI wanted to play against Germany, but my discussions with Italy, Austria and France clearly let me see that it was pointless. So I opted for the strategy that would see best to my possible survival. It's not a great strategy, and I don't like it one bit, but it's really all I got. I'm just buying time.\n\nBut hey! I'll give it to you. I'm playing crap here. And I'm sorry I had to move to St-p.

I think I've underestimated the importance of the diplomacy between England and Russia. It might be because both would rather avoid discussing Scandinavia and just see what they can get, but at the end of the day, that mentality only serves Germany.\n\nAnyway... random thoughts... but I am seeing a pattern and I'm pretty sure that there's a way out for both England and Russia.\r\n",

If Ank supports Con to Smy, Aeg should support hold at Smy while Smy supports Bul to Con and Greece supports Serb to Bul, that will get you Con. I'm sure Arm will support hold at Sev, so if Black Sea and Ank support hold at Con, we likely won't get Con regardless, so I'll input those orders unless you suggest otherwise.\r\n1 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: First of all, sorry for not getting back to you sooner. Life has been hectic as usual and I've been seriously neglecting the game.\n\nThat is an interesting set of messages. It's not too surprising to hear that from Germany, as he is a crafty player and would do what he can diplomatically to improve his chance of potential solo, or at least strengthen his position to insure his share of the draw. However, England also echoing that concern and specifically predicting that Germany would be sending that message is an interesting play. England is quite a skilled and intelligent player as well. His ability to diplomatically deflect the 3v1 situation that he was facing is quite a testament to that, and I certainly think he is aware that a strong CPA has formed. With a strong CPA, he knows he can't make it to the draw, but at the same time, he can't just come out and attack Germany and risk further galvanizing our alliance. His best play would be to create internal tension within our alliance to try to rip us apart, while working with Germany for the time being to possibly strengthen his position to be included in the draw.\n\nI have no grand delusions of a solo in this game. It's quite clear that you, Germany, and England are far too experienced let something like that happen. I believe the best play for me and for our CPA is to work toward the 3-way draw. Getting England out of the picture may be tricky, but I think we will be able to accomplish that. I concur with your observation that we have the failsafe of establishing the corner stalemate position (provided that we eventually clean Turkey and Russia out of that area) in order to prevent any possible ambitions of an EG alliance. However, I think that Germany is also aware that any long-term partnership with England is not in his best interests, as none of us want to see our 3-way draw turn into a 4-way draw, and hopefully he doesn't have any ambitions to leverage a partnership with England to set up for a solo attempt, which I think would only make a great mess of things.\n\nBy the way, England and Germany did not mention anything to me about watching out for an Italian solo. Actually, England has been trying to pit me against Germany, telling me that he thinks that Germany may try to solo and that we need to unite to squash that threat. I imagine that England is also talking to Germany trying to pit him against you, in order to negotiate his way into the draw possibly with you cut out of the picture. England needs to expand into France to strengthen his position and working with Germany is the only way to accomplish that.\n\nOk, that's enough paranoia and speculation for now. I think the less paranoid interpretation of the situation strongly reinforces the notion that Germany is committed to the CPA. Before the spring moves, he was facing potential hostility from E, F and R, but he was able to diplomatically influence England into making moves that went quite well for Germany. He moved into Sweden and can take Norway this fall as well. If he follows through with that, it'll be devastating blow on England and remove any worries about England and Germany.\r\n2 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Ok, as for moves: Yes, I agree that your suggestion would probably be best. It's a safe set of orders that guarantees Smy and a Turkish disband and makes a safe play on Con if Turkey does something stupid. However, it's probably most likely that Turkey will just hold Con with support from Bla and Ank.\nJust to reiterate:\nGre S Ser -> Bul\nSmy S Bul -> Con\nAeg S Smy\n\nBy the way, I offered Turkey support into Sev last turn and I actually issued that order. I'll offer the same thing to him again (but I won't actually give the order this time). It would be ideal for us if used Ank to cut Arm and attacked Sev with Bla, but I know it's quite a long shot.\r\n3 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: All sounds perfect, great analysiss, I'm excited we are so in tune to each other's way of thinking. I too pefer to see this CPA to the end, so will try to check my paranoia. I've got along well with Germany, and even though England is trying to pull me on his side, I will just play nice long enough to get Germany and me into position to take him down. All's looking good and I've submitted those orders we discussed. Good luck with Russia and the north!\r\n4 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Germany is saying that the other powers are telling him that you and I have been trying to undermine him diplomatically. He seems quite annoyed, but it seems that he'll may likely give us the benefit of the doubt. I'm trying to reassure him.\r\n5 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: He sent me a major paranoid message too. My bet is England is making some guesses and pushing his buttons. I sent Germany a long message telling him I'm 100% behind the CPA, which I am, I'm just 200% behind our alliance, so if he freaks out and does something crazy then we have the option to pull in someone else, I just hope he can keep it together.\r\n",

No need to actually do anything other than build it in Marseille and let it look threatening. A bit of gunboat diplomacy in its truest form :).\n\nOh, it would be useful to know your intentions. Most French players in your situation will quite happily spend a year or two utterly focused on England to avoid making a decision on what to do next, but I rather suspect you're somewhat more proactive.\r\n2 FRANCE -> TURKEY: I still have to decide my future plan actually. After England, there are only two options really and both are interesting for different reasons. It would also help here to know what your intention is. Want to stick with Russia for a while or do you intend to break that alliance up in the near future?\n\nThis would impact the game given that RT staying together in the near future is best served by France attacking Italy and Germany together with you both. On the other hand, if you start fighting Russia, you might be helped more by a strong Germany that can help you deal with the Tsar, and you and I can work against Italy together in the meanwhile.\n\nAll you say is under the strictest confidentiality.

Not only does England stab her allies whenever she wants to (Germany and I are proof of that, a \"Western Triangle Alliance\" becoming an English Empire), but if I go, England and has you enclosed and quite probably flanked. You can take Italy, but that will still leave you enclosed, and England can then just filter in his massive navy into your Med. and all the way up the Adriatic; it'd take you and Turkey staying together to put up any sort of resistance, and, again, even then it would be a long drawn out war, and could very well end in England grinding you down (you WOULD be first in the way of his hurricane of fleets, Turkey'd have a bit more shelter, you're right there.) ~N~ ~N~ That fleet in the MAO sparked a war between England and I as he violated my waters (when I left HIS EC alone.) That fleet in the Western Med is undoubtably there to help take Spain- but it won't stop there, and it won't be the only Engish ship in the area soon.... ~N~ ~N~ I want to survive right now, not win.

I got a message from England, asking if I'd support him into MAO, and he'd support me to Por because England wants to survive. Fair enough, but then Germany sends me a message saying I should consider having England go to MAO, it could help, and even though last time we talked he said he would be okay with me going to Tyrolia, he now asks if it can wait a season or two &and& wants to make sure it's okay if he can go to Gascony, etc., etc. The Germany has the Englishman in his hip pocket, England asked me to help him because England wants to survive this game, but it's not because he's offering to help me solo (which he clearly cannot offer), it's because he has already cut a deal with Germany to help the German solo. Russia may have even cut the same deal, so beware!\n\nPS - Germany once said something to me about being afraid of you moving into Finland, that may actually be a good options at some point, the less comfortable Germany is right now, the less likely he goes for a solo and the more likely we three-way draw.\n\nThoughts?\r\n1 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Those are some interesting developments. Let me mull it over. Also, I can't chat much since I'm at work now, but I'll be on later tonight.\r\n2 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Sounds good. Germany is saying he will draw for sure, but what else is he supposed to say? I'm watching him closely, hopefully I'm just over-reacting.\r\n3 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Overall, I still think we're in pretty good shape. We don't need to push Germany back to be on par with us, we only just need to ensure that he stays under 18 Scs.\n\nOf course, to just hold your end of the line keeping what you currently have, you would need to get fleets into Gol, WMS, and Naf.\n\nWorst-case would be if England and France did everything they could to help Germany solo, which in the near-term would be to help him put a power-3 attack on Spa for the fall. Hopefully, some diplomatic words can rectify this situation. Perhaps, ask Germany not to enter Gas if his intent is to merely draw. Also, England and France might be jaded enough to refuse to cooperate with Germany. How does that situation look as of now?\r\n4 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: On my end of the line, I certainly hope that Russia hasn't made a deal with Germany to make things difficult, but I think I found a set of moves that'll work relatively safely regardless. Tyrolia is a key territory and I can force you in from Ven this Spring, but Boh and even War aren't critical, as we could also just fall back to the Tyr, Vie, Gal, Ukr, Mos line. As long as you hold your end, that would still leave us with 18 Scs combined.\r\n5 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Germany said he'd send me a long response tonight, so we'll see. I'll ask Germany about Gas, I've already told him I don't want him there, so I will stand my ground and hope for the best. I can support myself to Tyrolia, so no worries there, you can use your units to do as you see fit.\r\n",

I am excited! :-)\nI think our plan is quite straight forward. But let me know if there is anything you else on your mind or any other thoughts you want to share. Or if you change your plans - message me so we can figure something else out. But this does seem to be the best move this turn.\r\n4 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: No change of plans on my side. I'm hitting Tri and moving out of the BS. You've been a very solid ally so far and I have no desire to risk it. Italy is talking to me a lot also... but it simply makes no sense to change sides.\r\n5 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: Great! Fingers crossed this all goes well.\r\n",

So maybe it&s better Pic support hold Bur while Brest move to EC and we have a decent chance to put you into Bel on the Fall without risking to lose nothing.\r\n4 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I agree, Pic will support hold at Bur. MAO will support hold at Spain and Gas should also support hold at Spain since Italy tells me Westmed and Lyo will support Mar to Spain. I will send Italy a message to encourage him to do that so that our defenses hold. I am pretending with Italy I am on his side to increase the odds of our success this season, I hope it works since if it does we will be in great shape for fall! :)\r\n5 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I suppose another option is for Spain to support Bur to Mar, since MAO and Gas will support hold at Spain and Italy tells me West Med and Lyo are supporting Mar to Spain, this would kill that army since Ven is attacking Pie. The main problem being that Germany will likely support an attack on Bur. Pic is still updated to support hold at Bur, but if you want to give taking Bur to Mar a shot, then let me know and I'll have Pic attack Bel in case Italy changes things up and you don't get Mar, to counter Bel supporting Mun to Bur, which is likely what Germany will order along with Hol supporting hold at Bel.\r\n",

I think I can talk Italy down from this, it makes FAR too much sense for him and me to secure our southeast stalemate position and for him to shift at France to help you out while I finish Russia off and then I can help you with Scandinavia eventually... Are you still with us?!\r\n1 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: Yes, I'm still with you. I'm going to do my best to hold strong against France and England, but it's anybody's game right now. Except Turkey's.\r\n2 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: I wouldn't give Russia much hope either, personally!\n\nI'd be ecstatic with a three-way draw and a middle power alliance has made all the sense in the world to me since day one, so that is my goal... Hopefully Italy will see the light and realize if he leaves France unchecked that France may very well end up with 14,000 points to his name!\r\n3 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: So, can you imagine Ska attacking Norway? What if Mos supported Norway to Stp while Norwegian slid into Norway? Baltic could cover Swe while Kiel covers Den, Ruh covers Kiel and Sil covers Mun... This could get you to seven centers and a build! Think about it and let me know since Mos hitting Sev would be useful as well, but the highest priority is keeping you as strong as possible, which will also result in you being able to slow down the E/F as much as possible...\r\n4 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: I am 100% aligned with a central powers alliance; France and England are, quite obviously, my biggest threats right now, and I must handle them. I'd love to take St. Pete; I can see that it would help both of us immensely, and if there's something I've learned this game, it's that you put a dying dog out of its misery. If Moscow will support Norway to St. Pete, I will move Norway to St. Pete and NWG to Norway per your suggestion. Similarly, Silesia will move to Munich to help cover my home centers. I've thought long and hard about this, and it is a great plan. I will gladly take your support into St. Pete.\n\nFrance will get, at most, one build this turn, and after Italy's moves I can see that we are in a delicate situation. In the interest of equal growth, would you consider letting Italy hold onto Trieste, Smyrna and Ankara so that he can equip his western front with enough firepower to push back France? I would consider it a long-term investment in our continued viability, and a strong strategy to contain E/F. I eagerly await your response.\r\n5 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: Great, glad you are onboard! Moscow will support you into Stp, that works for both of us as you suggest. France is a HUGE concern and I am in agreement on Italy keeping Trieste, Smy and Ank. Glad the three of us finally appear to be on the same page, I've been pushing this Central Powers alliance since day one, here's to our success!! :-)\r\n",

I will try to answer as honestly and openly as I can, but please keep this to yourself. Germany is in my opinion a skilful player.

If we want to avoid or limit that risk, there is always the possibility of dealing with him together, but it also depends on your objectives.\n\nI am curious to hear what you think. Let us not discuss anything with Germany about our conversations.

Thanks for letting me know, though.\r\n1 TURKEY -> ITALY: How do you want to handle this turn? I was thinking if we can have you pop a fleet, I could rebuild it in con and get into bs without warning that way, maybe? Haven't considered it in too much depth. Plus an army build to go to arm, and should be pretty good. Or maybe something else?\r\n2 ITALY -> TURKEY: If things were merely busy, I guess I could handle press as usual. I'd say things are unrealistically complicated - not sure where you're from, but from where I am, the way the whole covid-19 things is being handled is simply surreal, to add a bit to other ongoing issues.\n\nBy popping a fleet you mean arranging for the disbanding of one of your fleets?\n\nThis sort of thing could be great, and seeing you overtake Russia would be a major improvement to the board as a whole.\n\nYet, due to sleepiness, I'll again delay any serious commitment at least until tomorrow.\r\n3 TURKEY -> ITALY: If you need a pause feel free to ask for one, gold has been really good about them and I don't think any of us would mind. I know I've gone over the supposed 2 day limit in other rounds.\r\n4 ITALY -> TURKEY: I didn't know I could possibly go past the two days... I've already asked for my two days. In any case, as we're dealing with some previously unforeseen major relationship issues, I assume my distress will be longer than any reasonable pause. Besides, despite it being difficult to force myself to actually focus around here, I find it beneficial to have at least this obligation, work and university being halted by covid.\n\nThanks for the tip, though!\n\nApart from re-asking the questions about disbanding one of our fleets, and encouraging you again to take advantage of Russia's collapse, I wonder how you see the game developing in the next few years!\r\n5 TURKEY -> ITALY: Sorry, yesterday turned out pretty busy.\n\nSorry to hear about your relationship, I know it's been a tough time for a lot of partnerships lately but I'd still rather that have stayed an abstract for you.\n\nAs for the game, yes, popping a fleet I meant disbanding one of mine as you head west so that I can rebuild it next to bs. I'm not really sure where the game is headed to be honest, this hasn't been my best round but life has conspired to out it on the back burner a bit, and so combined with not having many people besides you talking a lot, I'll admit I've been giving it less focus than I'd like. I don't think that either of us will do well if we commit to fighting, though, so I'm hoping to see you head west to take advantage of England and Germany's squabble before they make peace. Germany won't be able to make meaningful progress on his own, so you should be able to cut a sweetheart deal for your fleets against England with him I'd think. Meanwhile, a concrete signal of you actually backing off and sending units against another power would enable me to do the same and turn north. I'd expect we'd be able to eventually finish off one or the other of Germany and England and probably bog down at a 3wd after that, unless you want to try and push for a 2wd which I'd be ok with trying since as I said you're the only one really talking and I've enjoyed the communication. If the tournament is going well for you, or you want to optimize our scoring, I think I'd even be ok with us getting to the end and flipping a coin or whoever has the most points from other rounds or something, and giving that person the solo.\n\nThat was a long message, sorry more rambling than I'd intended. How do you see the game developing?\r\n",

        "intent_dialogue": "0 ENGLAND -> ITALY: Any response to my suggestion? Can you help me take Paris to force Germany to play fair?\r\n1 ITALY -> ENGLAND: Hey! I'm more than interested in keeping Germany under control, which is why I took so long to eliminate France, whom I intended to employ as a proxy for that. However, France tried to outguess Germany's moves three times even though each time I had handed Germany's planned moveset beforehand!!! Anyway, that proved way too ineffective.\n\nI have a problem, though. While long term containing German growth is evidently a priority, it makes little sense/is somewhat unfeasible to attack Germany while Russia and Turkey are poised to tear Austria apart. I mean, directly attacking the only other power in condition to assist with armies is rather risky.\n\nThat can easily change, though. Turkey, at least on paper, seems open to an assault on Russia, as far as I have assessed. Perhaps, if you could push Turkey towards that, my situation would become easier and allow me to immediately join your forces against Germany. I'm on those talks as well, but we haven't so far reached any sort of agreement regarding the Med or even the division of Austria, as our little arms race can show.\n\nAn alternative would be talking to Russia, but I assume Russia wouldn't be willing to listen to you. Besides, has Russia even bothered to answer you recently? I can't get a single word as answer!\r\n2 ENGLAND -> ITALY: I'm not saying \"direct assault on Germany now\", I only asked for a support into Paris for now. with an army alone, he cannot defend it, and he's certainly not in a position to attack Russia alone if we are united in France. I can only ask that you consider it, but he is now saying he'll only work with me if I keep North Sea as a DMZ, which seems far too trusting of me to do now that he's blatantly taken advantage of me to steal my build. He didn't even set his units in a way to advance his cause toward Russia with any greater speed, so the 3 armies looking at Burgandy would seem to indicate he thinks he can direct armies westward with no risk. We may have to fight to defend our French acquisitions soon regardless, I'm just trying to be ready early\r\n3 ITALY -> ENGLAND: I get what you're saying, but to move one army against Germany without having further resources to bring in is tantamount to scratching a lion with a short stick, let alone when there are other two powerful land powers marching my way. So, any hostile action of my army will likely trigger a German reaction.\n\nWhat makes this whole situation weird is Russia's unexpected unwillingness to answer press. Has Russia bothered to write you in the last month or so? It appears as if Turkey hijacked Russia's mind.\n\nIn other circumstances, we could perhaps work with Russia. That could settle the issue with Turkey, and allow Russia and I to contain Germany on land, despite your advances in the North. Or at least give me hope of not facing a full Jugg without Germany. As it stands, I must assume Russia will never be a partner, as s/he consistently fails to answer. I mean, no kidding, Russia answered with one line on June 6th. Since them, I sent messages on June 11th, [1643277]&, [1626053]&, [1406554]&, and short notes almost daily since then. (& denote a solid message, either elaborate or with a clear question)\n\nWith that in mind, either I have Turkey on my side or Germany, otherwise I can't contain their armies. And Turkey is an unlikely partner, especially if Russia has a solid position and Austria is gone to Turkey. However, Turkey has signalled some interest in shifting North. Can you help me make that a reality? If we can get any agreement that, provided something, Turkey will move on Russia, I can seriously consider fighting Germany.\n\nOtherwise, I fail to see how I could survive the consequences. I'm more than eager to be convinced of the contrary, so feel invited to present your arguments!, even if I find it unlikely.\r\n4 ENGLAND -> ITALY: Russia had been entirely silent to me until yesterday, so I just figured he was a scorned and bitter player, but all of a sudden he's also willing to cooperate with me to fight Germany, &as long as I move Stp away from him\n\nThese protracted games are so annoying. Germany will only cooperate with me if I keep North Sea DMZ forever, Russia will only work with me if I entirely retreat... with my units as far separated as they are, it seems like everyone is requesting I do nothing or retreat as a condition for working together, which is annoying. But if a Jugg smashes Germany, I'd be ok with that, as I still have the backdoor on Russia and the current army distribution means Germany is in more trouble than I am (so far). But I understand your point; perhaps Spain to Mar and Por to Spain(sc) means you can cover your gains while still being in my neighborhood?\r\n5 ITALY -> ENGLAND: We'll find a way to settle everything alright, and cooperate to achieve our goals, even if we must not be as direct as we'd like.\n\nFor now (I hope to write you again before moves, more in depth), I strongly encourage you to bounce me in Mao! This will allow us to delay anything happening in the West, while keeping Germany under the illusion that I'm working against you.\r\n",

I will also move out of the Irish Sea and into MAO, so you dont have to waste a fleet sitting in the West.

I'm making any argument I can think of to the Russian, including throwing out ideas that you and I don't fully trust each other, so the Russian doesn't think we'll just quickly turn on him once Turkey is dead... which we will do, of course, if we can, but I'm thinking the F/G will require us to work with the Russian... Thoughts?\r\n3 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: It all makes sense. If possible, get the Russian to contact the English. He looks cd, but maybe he'd start fighting again if he knew he had an ally. If England fought, especially helped by Russia, it would slow F/G down.\nI can pin the German down. I thought maybe we could get him in on an Anti-russian attack, but it's tough to trust him. He spent the past couple turns encouraging me to attack France and then helping France, which means... what?

I'd much rather you have Tunis than Turkey. It will give you a foothold on the Ionian as well. Bad move by Turkey.\r\n",

        "intent_dialogue": "0 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Thank you for your detailed response, I will try to be as detailed in mine.\n\nIndeed, you have a difficult posture due to my position in the North - but this also assures me that I have the upper hand for now and can handle a two front war with RF if need be. I appreciate that you are willing to set aside your unease and work in concert. I will not let you down so easily.\n\non burgundy - part of it was to assure you of my intent and motivation. part of it was to counter a potential French stab that I was concerned with. regarding russia - you can lay your heart at east on that front as well. I have a some tricks up my sleeve that you will be happy with, but just like the burgundy situation, i'd rather not divulge them as it does not benefit either of us.\n\nhowever, I do have some 'marching orders' for you to consider... I want you to move Sweden to Norway. this will be KEY in making sure we get what we want and will likely produce a build for you this year. so please trust me. I am sorry I can not divulge ALL my moves to you nor tell you what Russia's moves are for fear that you will change your moves. if we continue down this path of trust and I do not see you turning on me with French (or Russian) help, then in a short season as you see my moves and I see your further commitment, then I can tell you the why and how of the moves as well. I know this is a big request, but as you said yourself, if I was going to stab you for a measly gain in edi and to be stuck between russia and france, I could do that anyways right? so please trust me.\n\nin the south, York to Lvp is critical and I expect it to get in.\n\nI think either wal or lon to ech can work fine. but I personally think Lon to Ech is much more important right now. yes, you want to get north and I will readily cede it to you but first and foremost, I hope you take Irish. the main reason I say not to move wal is that there is a scenario under which wal may be needed to cover liverpool in the fall and if you don't have the unit in wal, it could throw my ability to help you take norway difficult.\n\nin the end, i wont be prickly on this particular point, for now I will put in North support London to Ech, but after you have considered things further, if you still feel you MUST move wal, then I will change my support. but Swe to Nwy and York to Lvp are key.\n\nas for my own moves in the south, suffice to say that I do not want to give you my moves for the same reasons you outlined yourself. no gain for you and if france blocks me then it would make me doubt you right? so best not to worry about it.\n\nlike I said, I have reason to believe that russia will not have the free hand in the south that he hopes to have. let me leave it at that.\n\nI'm committed to us... in great part because I can write you a long message like this and I know you'll respond in kind - with detail and expertise. I like that and find that games with partners such as you are far more fun and enjoyable than games with partners who write a few lines and can't think in abstract terms about the 'bigger picture' or about strategy. so thanks for your diplomatic style. ;)\r\n1 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Thanks for the message. I'm sadly not able to reply now and likely won't be in a position to do so until tomorrow. You will hear from me as soon as I can sit down at the cpu and think things through for a minute.\r\n2 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: no problem. we have 28 hrs\r\n3 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Yeah... Sorry I can't get to this now... My mental space is full of ... real life issues. I hope those will clear sufficiently enough by tomorrow morning.\r\n4 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: So I've read your message again with a clearer mind and here's what I have to say.\n\nYou're asking an awful lot out of me! You're more or less asking me to walk blinded through a tight and twisting corridor with only sparse words coming from you to aid my progress... I'm not comfortable with this and it's not something I'll keep doing for much longer, as I'm sure you'll understand (and your message seems to indicate that you're aware of that, so I'm not too worried).\n\nSwe will go to Nor, Yor to Liv, Lon to Channel and Wales to Irish. The last move will either bounce and cover both the Irish and Wales, or set me up to take MAO in a year or two. The first alternative is more likely...\n\nRussia trusts you a lot, but is nonetheless plotting your demise. I'm not saying that so to gain your trust as there's really not much for me to do on that front: either you're in fact allied with me or you're not, but it's not a question of trust that will decide that for you at this point. No, it's more simply that I'm trying to help the person I consider my ally be aware of possible dangers. Russia has explicitly talked about how we share an interest in controlling your growth. He would have me move in such a way as to force you into a tough spot in the fall, more or less forced to support him into Sweden (which he is convinced you will do).\n\nFrance is not trustworthy and I'm not hearing much about him from other powers. As far as I know from what he told me, his plan is still to set himself up against you and vacate my seas. Like I said, I put very little faith in his words, but I did see them as an opportunity to throw the WT out there once more. I told him that we had not yet suffered too greatly at the hands of one another and that our positions are still quite solid if we were to decide for that kind of strategy. His reply was that we needed, among other things, to break AR and see to it that Italy doesn't have much to hope from A or T.\n\nA WT could still be tempting to me, of course, but for now I'm only committed to this. I suggest we see how the next phase turn out where France is concerned and sell the WT if it seems likely that he'll play for it. Once the WT is on track, if that should happen, you and I would need to work right away on how we would take France out of the mix...\n\nI take great comfort in your words and find many reasons in your messages to believe that you are indeed as dedicated to EG as I am. I'd like to offer more input, but since you seem to have the situation quite under control and do not feel ready to share intel with me, there's not much I can say that wouldn't ring like futile assumptions.\r\n5 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Thank u for ur trust. U will not be dissapointed. I can promise that.\n\nAfter this turn, france will no longer trust me and u will be in ech for sure. Russia will still think I'm with him and will get a rude surprise in the fall.\n\nThanks again for ur trust\r\n",

I didn't get back to my comp in time to change the unit taking Bul. Agreed that it would have been better to have my fleet on ION. Con or Smy should be open for a fleet build after this. We may need it, depending on what Italy does.\n\nWhat do you think? Can you turn Italy around? I will try to do the same.\r\n1 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: For Fall, I think you hit Sev with two units, Rum being the mover. I will send one unit in unsupported into Rum in case you get in. That way you get a build worst case, and we both get builds best case and I could use the build to put one more unit on Italy if he doesn't steam west.\r\n2 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: Yeah, I think you're right. That's probably the best move. I'll support Rum up to Sev. Probably won't work, but Russia can't cover everything. Worth a try. Con will go back to Smyrna obviously.

England intends to manoeuvre the fleets out of Scandinavia (otherwise, how else to get the Edinburgh army out of England?). England has also asked me to have Portugal - which could be a sensible way of dividing French holdings -, but what do we expect England to do once Portugal and Brest are conquered? There is nowhere else England can push the fleets (and now armies, which should be a direct threat to us) other than against us.\n\nI say we take immediate action. I can sail to Mao at once, and you can significantly delay English plans by bouncing Nor-nth.

If you were to move another army to Burgundy, that would be no problem, but I can't see how you would do that without leaving yourself vulnerable to Russia. Do you think England would be willing to possibly support your fleet into Brest?\n\nIf we either order Bur-gas, Mars S Bur-gas and Gol-spa, or Mars S Gol-spa and Bur-gas cuts support and France sneaks into Paris, France's only unit near Brest will be the army in Paris, which your army will be able to hit and ensure Pic-bre supported by the English fleet works. If you consider appropriate, I can already message England on that, urging the English fleet to support you in, instead of the other way around.\n\nThough in theory a setback, France will end up losing Spain and Brest, and conquering Paris, thus disbanding. You'll keep your SC count, and Paris will be easily retaken against a 2 SC France the next year. Given that Portugal will likely fall next year as well, I'll be able to afford handing you Marseilles as well, while I assume England will eventually want Brest.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this?\r\n1 GERMANY -> ITALY: I am moving paris to protect the sc & hopefully support eng to brest. Hope this is ok - i want to be a good ally\r\n2 ITALY -> ITALY: Ok, it seems to be all set regarding the convoy.\n\nI had an idea, though. Do you think you can possibly persuade Russia to enter flawed orders?\n\nI don't know how it would be best to pull that off, but our position would be even better if Serbia-rumania actually worked.\r\n3 ITALY -> GERMANY: Well, this is ok, but it appears to be slightly ineffective. But bear in mind that you'll need to move Bel-pic for the attack on Belgium to succeed, or else the single army in Gascony can effectively defend Brest.\n\nBut, just to understand your relationship with England, you don't think England would support you into Brest if, given France sneaking into Paris, it made more sense?\r\n",

I have not mentioned it to France yet, but I do think that he is cooperating against England. I figure 2-3 more game years to eliminate Italy, England & Germany. Interested? Or would you prefer to keep options open (4-way or race to solo)?\r\n1 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: A draw sounds like a good idea to me. I have to admit I am feeling a touch nervous about being the smallest (though most easily defended, I guess?) member of that proposed finishing group.\r\n2 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: You should pick up 2-3 Italian centers ... depending on what we do with Trieste/Venice. That should help. Of course, it is hard to say how things will go in the north. If England and Germany team up to make life hard for me, France could easily grow to 12 or so and use the builds to compete for some Italian centers (or push against me in the north). The reason I am proposing this to you instead of to France first is that (a) I think any dreams I may have had of a solo are too optimistic, and (b) you and I have developed a solid basis for trust. That means we can both devote most of our energy outwards and \"convince\" France that a draw is a better option than him pursuing a solo. Maybe.\r\n3 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I guess we will see.

For some reason, the game only allowed me to build in Paris, so I couldn't get a fleet at all during the fall. Once I get a few more supply centers, my fleets shall be patrolling the Mediterranean.\r\n3 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: Yeah... all your home supply centers are filled up. Let's see how it goes, but you may need to get Belgium to build another fleet. I mean, I'd rather not lose the center, but I'll be in trouble too if France is not strong.\r\n4 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: I definitely would not want to take that away from you. Don't worry about it for now. I have confidence that I can take away Italy's supply centers in time.\r\n",

Hold off on taking London for this turn, and take it next year. In the meantime, I can work my army back to Paris, as per our exchange, and then England will be dead so I can move my fleets south while you take those centers.\r\n1 GERMANY -> FRANCE: ?This makes no sense?\n\nOk, I guess the others talked a lot. But let's go through this one by one:\n1. Why move back to PIE? You will place in MAR anyway next turn and can then go back to take PAR and BRE? This is a full retreat and you're giving them a center. I cannot support myself to VEN alone - it's 2 vs. 3 if TRI helps.\n\n2. You don't want me to take LON, but are ok to lose another center? Come on, you can't expect me to be ok with this in any way. What is the point? I don't want to lie to you, I'm moving as I told you - GAS-BUR, BUR-MUN, NS-LON, HOL-NS with support from NOR. I am in a position where I really think I don't need to lie to you.\n\n3. Look, my main objective for this game was to make up for missing game 1. I can achieve this with a 3-way or 2-way draw also. I know that getting a solo will have implications, it always does...\n\nAnyway, my point is simple - I have a stalemate line against the East. They can't do anything to me, nor can they help you in any way. I don't want to fight you, as this will only lead me to a draw. However, we need to keep pushing east.\n\nFor all practical purposes if you control the Mediterranean you can always stalemate me there, so you will hold me hostage if I decide to attack you in full.\n\nIt is in your interest to take Italy, I am not joking about this. Look at the map and you will see that this will give you value and power that you do not have currently against me. If we fight now you'll die, and I have a good shot at finding other allies on similar terms, a lot of people are desperate in this situation.\n\nI am really not ok with retreating from Italy. This will be a huge mistake and you're not doing yourself a favor. TUN and VEN are exactly the reason I am interested in working with you, otherwise I would have accepted AUS/It's offer of a 3-way draw a long time ago.\n\nI'd strongly suggest that you stick with me on this one. Unless I'm missing something it will be plain wrong to go against me at this point. I have no problem with you planning for your 'independence', it's only normal, but let's be smart and not lose the game over it.\r\n2 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I'm not losing the game over it. The retreat from Ven was not a proposition to go against you. You have a glut of armies, and if you are indeed moving out, you will have enough to take Italy. I was not thinking about a build...poor calculations on my part. Like I said before, I look at this map for about 5 minutes a day. I'm far from in form here.\n\nObviously I lose if I fight you. I'm not thick. But you are nearly accusing me of turning against you, when all actions I have done have been in support of you. You moved into my homeland, and I supported you. You then took my home centers against my wishes, and I supported you. You then moved south which serves no purpose but to launch at attack on Spain and Mar, and now I am the one who is being called into question for raising some minor concerns about my remaining centers? At what point did that sound like me attacking you?\n\nI have fleets all over the Med that over power all others. I have no means of opposing you on land. Please stop threatening me with ultimatums. You don't want me to move to Pie? Fine. I will take your support to Rome. You take London, I take Edi, I build in Mar, I take back my centers.\n\nWatch. This is me trusting you again. Again. And again. If I were judging by past moves, one would assume that Mar will be gone next turn. But this is my attempt again to prove myself wrong. Let's see what happens.\r\n3 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Sorry if I was too harsh. I have no issue with anything you've done so far and know you've done nothing against me the whole game. I just reacted like this because what you suggested was not optimal and it sounded like an ultimatum itself - I couldn't just agree to it.\n\nAs for you trusting me - I know I cannot expect this from you - so I'm asking you to trust me, I am trying to explain how I see things, so that we can reach a logical conclusion and move in a way that is constructive for both. Forget the trust, let's approach this more pragmatically.\n\nI have pushed the others into the corner without any ability to react, you can go all the way to TUR and we can eliminate everyone else if they don't get organized soon. They way things are going this may very well end up as a 2-way draw.\r\n",

I have been pretty open with Austria, so maybe Austria is the one leaking info, I don't know sine I don't know what you are talking about. Perhaps others are making good guessing and getting you to confess things you shouldn't? I thought we were good to go. You see Gas supported me into Mar, and we have discussed me staying on France's good side, until the proper moment, is your \"freak out\" related to that somehow?\n\nEngland is very good at twisting things and guessing what others may be saying. As I told you, England told me that you would say something about Austria, and then you did. Perhaps he's got you confessing things he was merely guessing at?\n\nGive me a few more details and I'll give you an honest answer, but for now, I'm with you 100%, as well as with the CPA 100%.

France will, I think, work with us as he has said he will switch sides as long as he can guarantee particpating in a draw that leaves him surviving.\n\nI think a blockade is workable here. Moscow and Sev support each other, Ukraine supports Warsaw, Gal supports Warsaw, Rum supports Gal, Vienna and Tyrolia support each other, Venice works with Rome, whilst Adriatic, Ionian, Mars, MAO, Tunis fleets can set up a blockade in the west.\n\nSmyrna, Sev and Bul can take down the remains of Turkey, leading to an extra unit for Italy and Russia to assist in stalemate duties.\n\nFrance, Austria, Russia and Italy work for a five way draw with Germany - eminently achievable, as the stalemate line is already there in most places.\n\nI'm copying this to all parties - France, Austria and Russia (to who this message was originally written).\n\nI seriously think this will work. Otherwise, we just limply hand the win to Germany, and concede defeat in the League season after just two games, as a win in the last two games is unlikely...\r\n",

        "intent_dialogue": "0 TURKEY -> ITALY: Sorry, your message came in after I'd gone to sleep last night.\n\nThat's very flattering about my press, I don't know that I deserve it but I appreciate the compliment :). I'd say actually you have my vote for best press, but that being turkey hasn't been too bad; people at least talk on this board. One of my other rounds as Austria, I have seen, without exaggeration, 3 messages from Russia the whole game so far, two of which were in global and not about the game. Compared to that, having Austria threatening to throw the game is pretty palatable!\n\nMy current plans for the fleet, which is why I sent Smyrna instead of con to Aegean, is once I can control Greece and Serbia, con goes back to BS, and then I have one fleet to play defense while I build armies to push further north into Austria, with the second fleet either supporting that defense or helping against Trieste.\n\nOf course that depends on what allowances and support I can get from you, but with Austria taking such a hard line he gets the power or he throws to Russia, at such an early stage, I don't see him as being someone that I could work with long term. I suspect if his press to me is like this, he wouldn't have been endearing himself to you either, and so I'm hoping to get your support against him in exchange for Trieste and some combination of moving the fleets further back and providing a strong front against Russia by being the one in bud to provide you a buffer. I know currently Austria provides that buffer, but hopefully you see me as a better long term option, plus the center in tri.\n\nThat's all a bit distant though - more immediately, I could support you to Greece so you can send an extra fleet to make progress against France, rather than just being a distraction while England makes progress.\r\n1 ITALY -> TURKEY: With no intention to downplay the title I just awarded you, but at times it is rare to find coherent sentences, well divided in theme-based paragraphs and making sense overall. In rougher seas, proper capitalization and punctuation also get positive marks. Anyway, it is clear you belong to the group of players who can play and communicate with ease, and, honestly, that's a relief. I've seen these bizarre behaviours in the tournament as well! Surprising.\n\nIndeed, I had not noticed you moved in from Smyrna, and I appreciate your explanation. Now, to business.\n\nAustria's relations with me are quite ok, actually, except for the fact that Austria does not seem thoroughly engaged in looking for viable long-term alternatives. It is as if they failed to see how close we're to being unable to stop a Jugg. In this, I hope you're genuine about your apprehensions about Russia, whose growth in Central Europe can easily outpace everyone else, should the attack on Germany work, especially considering England's passivity.\n\nAs for my view of the Balkans, yes, I'd like Austria removed, and Trieste does please me. I would be comfortable with a division where you got the majority of the Balkans (Bulgaria, Serbia, Rumania and Budapest to start with, beyond any questioning), provided your units, especially your fleet, are deployed in a non-threatening manner.\n\nYet, and I ask your forgiveness beforehand, I can't immediately jump in. Firstly because I have no available resources of my own (though the advance on France seems assured, now) to tackle Austria and do my part of it, and secondly because I need some reassurance that you'll not just take the opportunity and get yourself into Ionian.\n\nWhile I understand the advantages of getting your fleets past Greece, it will just force me to fight a long uphill campaign as an underdog, which I hope I'll be able to carry on thanks to possible gains in the West. Besides, it will help raise the alarm throughout the board regarding 'Turkish aggressive expansion' - everyone tends to be very compassionate towards Italy, if Italy is the last bastion of defence against Turkish fleets all the way to England.\n\nSo, in advance, I give you my word I'll respect your sphere of influence, especially as I'm concerned with Russia growing too much. I appreciate the offer of support into Greece, and assume we'd have to debate how Vienna and Greece would be handled, but that's for the future. I would be glad to assist you in Greece in one season or two (even if I suspect you don't actually need my assistance). But all that would require you not attacking Ionian.\n\nMore than simply not attacking Ionian this very season, which I expect you not to, I'd obviously ask you to redeploy your fleets in a less threatening way. I acknowledge, though, that you'd be unable to do that without showing your true colours to Russia, so this needs perfect timing.\n\nConsequently, I suggest you use Eas to hit Ionian, while you attack Greece (Alb-gre with double support). This disbands the Austrian fleet, keeps you with five Scs, showcase your intentions of not getting past Ionian, and allows me to convoy to Albania with Austria's assent, from where we can easily support you into Serbia. If timed along Con-bla, can get you Serbia and Rumania in the same year. Anyway, I digress.\n\nCan you commit not to actually attack Ionian? This is, to me, a necessary precondition to any cooperation.\r\n2 TURKEY -> ITALY: Just a quick reply before bed: I can definitely commit to not actually attacking ionian, but you can't convoy to alb anymore since your army is now in NA. (you're correct if guessing I was expecting the convoy last season which is why I went to alb in the first place, when I had entered moves before I read your message last season :) )\n\nSo for this season, am I correctly interpreting that you'd like to support hold Greece and have me cut the support so you can maintain good relations with Austria a little longer, but I still get Greece, rather than taking Greece yourself and building in Venice to get tri next year?\r\n3 ITALY -> TURKEY: As for your move to Albania, I know that feeling when you're confident to outguess your opponent and somehow things don't work as expected...\n\nAnyway, as for the convoy I mentioned, I meant for next season (Spring). I can conceivably move the army back to Tunis now, and the convoy may be exactly what Austria is hoping for in the Spring, thereby ensuring it happen, only to get you to Serbia/me in Trieste in the Autumn. I haven't figured all that already, but it was meant for the near future.\n\nYou not attacking Ionian (ideally, never attacking Ionian) is the single most important thing in ensuring this can work, so, exactly, my idea would be for you to conquer Greece without it being clear I'm hostile to Austria. I could not risk it all by going after Austria without knowing whether or not you'll comply with 'not attacking Ionian nor deploying aggressively towards that end'.\n\nConsequently, I naturally expect you not to conquer Greece with a fleet and follow with Con-aeg.

With our initial good relationship it would be a shame to waste it.

Would you like to convoy Tunis over this turn? I doubt you'll need it there any time soon the way France is looking.\r\n1 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I think we got extremely lucky with timing, and with Turkish choices. Given that Spain is a sure conquest, even if Turkey does break past Ionian, I'll have three fleets to fight that next year.\n\nAs of now, my army is free to join the fight. Albania, I assume?\n\nIt has a small problem, though. We must decide our moves wisely, as you can only keep Serbia by using both armies to support hold it, while my army needs support for the move to succeed. Given that Germany seems stalemated against Russia (and unable to build), but Russia can't simultaneously defend Rumania and keep you out of Galicia, maybe we should go into the offensive?\n\nI'll see if I set up my map later today to take a better look, but I'm certainly hoping you'll have bright ideas before that!\r\n2 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Actually, I have a horrible idea. Trieste s Tunis-albania, Budapest s Serbia-rumania, Vienna-galicia. It can be countered if they hold Rumania and take Serbia with Albania though. However, we'll have Galicia and Albania assuming Silesia remains where it is, which means it's a [1592570] and we can take it back. Except they still have Greece, which can cut Albania. That's the worst case scenario though.\n\nIt may still be our best option though. The only other good option I can see is the double support hold.\r\n3 ITALY -> ITALY: Ok, it seems to be all set regarding the convoy.\n\nI had an idea, though. Do you think you can possibly persuade Russia to enter flawed orders?\n\nI don't know how it would be best to pull that off, but our position would be even better if Serbia-rumania actually worked.\r\n4 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: This seems like a plan! Bold, but it appears we hold the advantage even if it goes wrong, unless Russia moves the armies in Germany in your direction. But well, in that case, what can we do anyway?\n\nI've entered the convoy to Albania!\r\n5 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Well I've asked Germany to attack Berlin and explained why it's important, so even if he moves those units after us it might be fine.

It's working title is Help Italy Solo, but there's another version very similar to mine that's called See If You Can Get Italy On The Verge Of A Solo And Then Screw Him Over For Spite And/Or Try To Get On A Stalemate Line For A Draw. Both titles are very good, and I'll let you decide in the end what to call it, and you can even think on it for quite some time!! :)\n\nAnyway, My guess is that Cly and Iri will bounce in Lvp. My first request would be that you take MAO to NAO while Por moves to MAO, Spain goes to Mar and Lyo goes to Spain. SO, if you take NAO, you live on, in whatever capacity you choose, but if you don't, Por won't take MAO and you die. I think it sounds like an interesting experiment, but my opinion is pretty meaningless, so let me know what you think, it would be fun and I think we'd both learn a thing or two &and& you can call it quits at any time... Please do give it your full consideration, it should be a learning experience at the least.\n\nPS - Please don't tell anyone anything we discuss, or if you are bitter with me and want to insure this game immediately ends in a three-way CPA, you can tell others, I don't really have much to lose, so it's your call! ;)\r\n1 ITALY -> FRANCE: PPS - Don't get me wrong, I'm all about getting revenge... So, maybe you want to get a bit of revenge against Germany?!?! :)\r\n2 FRANCE -> ITALY: Yeah, the name of my current plan was \"make sure Germany doesn't solo\". I'll consider moving to MAO\r\n3 ITALY -> FRANCE: Hey, you are in MAO, you'd need to move to NAO! Plus, you can't win if you are dead, you can't even draw when dead. I'm sure you will get other offers to consider, the longer you live, so you could give it a go for one year, even if your only goal is to totally freak the German out, he will &lose it&, guaranteed!\n\nAnyway, I'm a 100% revenge sort of guy, the person that I am most \"bitter\" with, I'll do anything/everything in my power to take them down, or at least put their demise in motion, I don't ever want anyone to ever think they can stab me and live to tell the tale, but I digress.\n\nHow about you update the order to attack NAO and sleep on it? If you don't attack NAO, you are virtually locking in a three-way and thus rewarding the German for how he's treated you in this game, which I hope you find even half as unacceptable as I do (though in a \"fun\", it's just part of the game, sort of thing, I'm not actually a raging lunatic, it's all in the spirit of war)!! :)\r\n",

You move on Bulgaria, this causes a bounce and blocks any possible Austrian retreat. If possible I will move on Turkey also to weaken them and after I betray Turkey will turn back on me.

That way, all we have to worry about is who we'll draw with in the east. I don't care if Russia is eliminated or not and the way things are shaping up, that will likely be the case unless I help him maintain the northern portions of the line.

He understands that I need the fleet for England.\r\n2 GERMANY -> FRANCE: good deal. Did he explain the fleet move to the tyrrhenian? If he did, I'm guessing that it was a defensive maneuver for the fleet in Marseilles.\r\n3 FRANCE -> GERMANY: Actually, his excuse was to make Turkey feel comfortable. I chastised him and said he should have moved to Tun, not something that is two moves off two of my Scs. He tried to equate it to my being in MAO, but I reminded him that MAO is two moves off one remote SC and requires either two fleets or a convoyed army and a fleet to take, where as Mar is much more [1230571] to his attack. He says he is moving to Tun and getting out of Tys. We'll see.\r\n4 GERMANY -> FRANCE: We'll see indeed. I honestly do anticipate him turning on Turkey. Turkey made a bonehead move in not securing Greece and instead building 2 armies. He landlocked a fleet in Armenia and bottled up more armies behind his line. If Italy attacks Serbia with 2 units and move the fleet to Greece and another to the Ionian, then Turkey loses a center in the spring with further potential losses in the near future.\n\nAlternatively, he could simply move fleets to the WES and TYN followed with an army move to Pie and put pressure on you in the south. This is less likely, though, since you can cover Spain, support a hold on Marseilles and don't have to worry about him taking the MAO for quite a while. The only way he would make ground is if he had the cooperation of England which I simply don't see. He's played rather intelligently and I do anticipate that he will continue to do so.\n\nHe also might continue to press Russia as well.\n\nI agree with you, though. The move to TYN is more threatening than a lone fleet build in Mar, especially given that he has more fleets in the waters than you do and Turkey has none to contend with. I'm sure the move was more based on going either direction depending on Turkish builds\r\n5 GERMANY -> FRANCE: We'll see indeed. I honestly do anticipate him turning on Turkey.

Russia seemed to have no interest in going after Austria, so attacking him myself wasn't really an option. And Italy seemed to want to attack me if he could keep France off his back, which thankfully he wasn't able to. I'm sure that Austria is thinking about stabbing me, but I'm not sure that changes anything.\n\nAs for France, I have to think he's really coming south this time. If he backs off again, that would seem very questionable. That doesn't mean he isn't still going to work with England against you though. Then again, I still haven't figured out what to make of England's move to the Channel, so maybe you have some hope there.\r\n2 GERMANY -> TURKEY: Thanks for the thoughts and insight!

Unfortunately he can break through into those.\n\nWould you mind if I moved into Constantinople? It would get me a build in the north where we really need it (if I can hang onto Vienna) or mitigate my losses if I don't. Down the road it can help in the Med if we can break through Italy, or you can force it out of its spot and I can disband it in favor of an army in the north. I know it is alot to ask, but I will get overrun by Germany/Italy without more units.\n\nAlso, I did reach out to France and he was considering turning on Germany, but I'm not sure we can count on him doing anything this turn.\r\n3 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: If you absolutely need to borrow a center then that's fine with me. The plan I propose would be: you move into Con, use your build to take a northern center. Once you've picked up that build we should disband your southern fleet so you can pick up another build in the north and really press your advantage. I can't advance much at the moment until pressure on the north end of Italy's line or a French expedition in the Med leaves Serbia vulnerable, so I will just hold my ground.\r\n4 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: Sounds good. Rumania will continue to hold Bulgaria and I'll be doing my best to make some progress in the north. If you can do anything to try to convince France to move into action, go for it.\r\n5 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I've reached out but haven't heard back yet. Will keep you posted.\r\n",

I have to cover it.\n\nAlso - it looks like you are making some headway in the south no? most likely you'll get black sea this spring as turkey covers ankara and smy covers con dont you think? My understanding regarding Sweden was that you had offered it to me this year. am I recollecting correctly?\n\nOf course, if I can convoy across successfully and get edi, then that is a moot point, I will have the build I need to face off against F (and I was hoping for italian help though now that he and austria are fighting, i'm not so sure I'll get it). But if I can't get Edi this year, if I'm blocked etc, i was hoping to pick up a build from sweden.\n\none idea that might help us both is if you move Norway to Norwegian and Stp to Norway, that way we will have two on edi and 3 on swe (or 2 if he bounces you) and we can ensure two builds between us, in which case we can split them.\n\nwhat do you think of that idea? to move nwy to nwg?\r\n1 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: Yeah, I like that idea. I am just a bit apprehensive of England moving to Finland. In which case, I'd have to cover St P with A NOR and thus be unable to help you into Sweden.\n\nI am very happy helping you get Sweden if I see that you are committed to moving against France. Otherwise, I am apprehensive about giving you another build. I am sure you understand. So if you make an attempt to hold Burgundy (or take Picardy, I think that would be easier), I will be happy to support you into Sweden. If not, I'll have to wait and see how the situation looks in the fall.\n\nAlso, I don't think Austria and Italy are fighting. Italy asked Austria to waive his build and it looks like Austria acquiesced.\n\nI also expect that Black Sea and Smyrna will bounce in Ankara. Turkey has might quite clear that he'll cede his centers to Austria instead of Italy and I.\r\n2 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: really? why would turkey do that? he attacked you not the other way around - and austria stabbed him after he gave austria help. does not make too much sense to me. I'll talk to turkey and see if he can be convinced to see the danger of austria. thanks for point out the waived build, I did think something was amiss last turn but did not pay enough attention to note it. you are right. what happened with the move to gre and gre to ion then? do you know?\n\nas for sweden, I would want my build exactly to be able to go after france. I will continue to press against france, you'll see that. so hopefully this should not be an issue.\n\nare you going to take nwg then? that will be very important in order to figure out edi/swe - like I said, I think we can figure it out in a way that we each get one build and we would not have to pick one over the other.\r\n3 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: Yes, I am going to take Norwegian.\n\nAustria promised Italy Greece, and Austria said that he'd move to Aegean with Eastern Med's support. I think Austria's move to Ion was just a misorder but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAs for Turkey, I don't know why he's giving Austria his centers, but he's publicly announced it.\r\n4 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: publicly? like to you guys in the south?\n\nahhh... the italy/austria situation now makes more sense. so that's why he did not build. so does this mean they are going to be allied now? where does that leave you with austria you think?\n\ni was hoping italy would get a build and help with france, I can still hope for a move to pie, but i'm not entirely sure if it will materialize.\n\ni think if we each get a build this season, that would make things much easier for us next year. I just hope that France does not retreat from England, that would be the worst outcome of my move to bur. =(\r\n5 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: I dont know, its tough to read Austria. He is saying all the right things. I think you have a shot convincing Italy to go to Piedmont; the deferred build should mean he's pretty trusting of Austria.\n\nAnd yes, Turkey sent all three of us identical messages saying that unless we stopped attacking him, he'd give Austria all of his centers. I assumed it was just a desperate gambit but so far it appears to have been a credible threat.\n\nWas the Burgundy move prearranged? France says it was; but I don't understand why he would tell me that (regardless of whether he's lying or not)\r\n",

I at the very least require Serbia back, I am unwilling to play the role of puppet state which will be quickly disposed of later. I think that is a reasonable request for co-operation and if you do not agree I will of course continue fighting you. I do believe it may be necessary to face E/G though, so I'm willing to work with you.\r\n2 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: So pull out of Serbia, but what would the actual cooperation look like? Would you also make peace with Russia, or you'd expect me to go north through him with your help for us to hit EG?\r\n3 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: I would be happy with either. Russia is getting severely weakened in the north, but on the other hand they are the only one of us currently in the north on the front lines. If you begin pulling back from my borders I can start moving units into Bohemia, Tyrolia, Galicia(?) and form a line there. To be honest you can't do much directly without going straight through Russia to get there, which is not necessarily a good idea.\r\n4 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: I agree Russia is important to keep as strong as possible of a front up in the north.\n\nSorry about how late a reply this is as well, I wasn't trying to drop this on you last minute and I still think figuring out how we could work together is something worth doing over the next couple seasons. But I don't think it's going to happen just yet.\n\nI just got very slow replies from Italy and Russia this turn though, and I think Italy is also an important part of the front line so I'm trying to avoid fighting him. The consensus seemed to be from Russia that it's more of a 'use his centers' vibe than a 'work with austria' plan. Maybe I'm being misled, but they seem more mission critical and selfishly otherwise I have nothing to do so I'll admit I probably didn't argue against it as well as I could have.\r\n",

Once it does, and if Austria moves F Greece- Aegean to bounce out a potential move to Aegean by F Con, then Italy can't be expelled from the Eastern Med. Once he has the Eastern Med, all they have to do is support another fleet into the Aegean, use that fleet to support Bulgaria into Con while tapping A Smyrna from Eastern Med and Turkey is down another SC. Rinse and repeat for taking Smyrna. I'm not seeing the \"impenetrable\" part. And that's if Russia makes no move against him. Turkey is on the ropes, and he knows it.\n\nThat's why I'm not particularly concerned about the juggernaut. It isn't as scary when it's just one Russian. I'm more worried about Italy and Austria, if they don't have a falling out.\n\nAfter France moved on London, Russia and I agreed to a temporary NAP; hence why I haven't moved on Stp. As that time has passed, however, I'm open to the possibility. I will sleep on your suggestion.\r\n1 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: alright sounds good, hope you sleep well\r\n2 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: So your suggestion, as I understand it, is for France to push through Piedmont while you and I move all our units east, to St. Petersburg, Finland, and so forth, and take down Russia as cleanly as possible.\n\nI doubt Russia would survive it. I'm just not sure where I'd go after St. Petersburg. Assuming you want Moscow, as most German players do, I wouldn't really have anywhere to grow. What is your plan for that point?\r\n",

I guess the safest option is both Gas and MAO support Spa while Bel support Lon again to Holl. I am not sure what to do about Par.

Moving to Pic will give me the chance to build for sure but could leave Bur to Germany.\r\n1 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: Yeah, I think MAO and Gas must support hold at Spain. I'd suggest Par to Pic, then build in Paris. Italy will be down to three units, so I can shift at Russia with less of a threat from Italy.\n\nACTUALLY, please have Belgium support Helio to Holland, I want to shift London to Yorkshire just in case Norway attacks Norwegian while Sweden shifts to Norway. Also, please confirm Bel will support Helio to Hol, just to make sure.\r\n2 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: Bel will support Helio to Holl no worries and I suppose EC will support NS.\r\n3 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: Yeah, I don't want to lose North Sea just yet, though I'm sure Russia will build another fleet NC Stp, so hopefully we get Italy under control soon so I can shift north.

England has cut a good deal with Russia at St. P, and Russia's strong at Warsaw and Moscow, meaning Austria needs to expand into Germany. If Germany and Russia stand, it wont be long before Austria and Turkey start looking at each other with hungry eyes.\r\n1 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I know you might not lend me any assistance as you're still distrustful of my good intention, though of course I could hope for your support at Belgium, but if you at least see to England's move at MAO and Italy, you'll find yet that I'm a good ally to you. If not, you'll be stuck between England and Italy, both of them more experienced players, and they both need your 5 SC for a win (good luck with that!)\r\n2 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I do think that you are viewing things in a much too simplisitic way. Italy is not geared to attack me, and I have no intention oif attacking her, and besides- she has so many better areas to expand. Austria or, if she IS allied with Italy, then Italy can attack you, unfortunaltely (even you admitted it), and then Turkey, if Italy and Austria want to get someone in the corner and take out a power (and I think, after the loss of Sevastopol, Russia would porbably help with that, too, unless Turkey and Russia reach an accord.) ~N~ ~N~ In any case, I am a threat to no one. England? He does have an unpredictable personality. Still, I don't watch trouble, so I'm not about to start a fight against him; let him go to the MAO- if he tries to attack me (and I hope he doesn't, I really hope the West can be settled so we can focus on the East, but if he tries, he'll find my centers covered) then I guess the Global community will have to take a look. ~N~ ~N~ To sum up my postion, if this is WWI Europe, then I'm really playing this more like I'm America than France- and that Burgundy line, that area, is my Atlantic ocean. So you can see why I needed you out- I don't want to get my hands dirty in this until I'm sure who's with me and who's not. I've spoken to everyone and, at times, everyone's seemed a friend, and at times, some have seen like enemies. One or two have remained consistent in their position; I'd like to think they're safe, and telling the truth (however much you can actually do that in this game) but most importantly- they are NOT a threat. 2 down, so that leaves four of you. And I'm getting a bout 3 stories from the 4 of you. So I'll stay here, moderate, work out deals, and play peacemaker if you want, but I'm content to wait until someone shows their colors. It's really a choice of two sides to take, and I think you know which sides those are- both say the other is going to attack me. I'm the bait- I'll see who goes first. ~N~ ~N~ If we form a coatlition, know I am, when in a serious one with no backstabbers or liars, loyal to the bitter end. ~N~ ~N~ And know that if you are my enemy, I WON'T just go away........ ~N~ ~N~ But again, I just say \"you\" because it's you i'm speaking to, no accusation being made. :)\r\n3 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Interesting points. If there's anything I've learned playing diplomacy its that trying to remain a 'neutral' power is a sure fire way to ensure that others ally against you, and when they attack you are without allies. In WTA Diplomacy, no one survives alone, even a vastly superior power. Well, as long as you're not attacking me, I guess I'll settle for that.\r\n4 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I said I have one or two I consider allies, I just am not helping, directly, with their military effort.\r\n5 GERMANY -> GERMANY: NOTES\r\n6 GERMANY -> GERMANY: France has taken Belgium, he is against me, and is onside with England I think\r\n7 GERMANY -> GERMANY: Yes, definitely allied with England\r\n",

Silesia can help hold the line in Berlin, which should be doable this year, especially if you can ensure that England doesn't move into Boh. Sweden will probably fall, giving England great control in the Baltic area. ~N~ ~N~ I really think the key here must be diplomacy. We must try to hold the line, especially with England (which I realize is mostly my charge), trying to create discontent so they are tempted to stab each other. What strategies do you think would be effective in trying to get England to stab France?\r\n1 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: i'm thinking push France to stab England .... so my focus is ensuring France doesn't get any further.\r\n2 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: i want to convoy to apulia, but you think i should cover bohemia instead?\r\n3 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: Can't you do both? Convoy Trieste -> Apu, then Serb -> Tri and Vie -> Boh and Bud -> Vie. We really need to start getting units to the front line. I have units spread all over the place, perhaps too thinly trying to cover so many different areas, and you have backed up units in the Balkans still.\r\n4 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: Also, England plans to take back Kiel this year. I don't know if that's planned or not, but either way Kiel plus Sweden will likely give England two builds. Hopefully if we can hold the line against France, if England does take Kiel, France will lose one SC.\r\n",

Sure you want to tie your destiny in this game to RUS and IT?\r\n1 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: No, and I was about to move on Italy once Smyrna fell. However, France's odd behaviour more or less ruined this.\n\nCan you give me a reason why you wouldn't keep going for a solo at this point?\r\n2 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: 1. Metagaming. My goal was to get a good result to compensate for missing game one. I can get this with a 2/3-way draw also. I don't want to be annihilated in the other two games, which is what will probably happen otherwise. It's just no fun.\n\n2. I am not so close to winning. Yes, I can take out FRA and he's sided with me, but he also holds me at gun-point, as without TUN and/or Italy I can never get to 18.\n\n3. I also feel it is right for FRA to be part of any potential draw, he's been my ally so I'd prefer to reward him rather than someone else. What you and IT suggested was that I take him out and draw with you two. I could not advance against you, so I had to get FRA to move from the South.\n\nIf I get a shot at a solo I might take it, who knows. However, we have one common goal - to reduce the number of survivors - I don't want a mass draw and unless you 'centralize' you won't make it.\r\n3 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: I will think on it... I also would rather avoid a mass draw, however my ability to keep you from a solo without Italy and now Russia is unfortunately limited (though in the last league, I did hold out for a 2 way draw with you when I could have taken a solo, so perhaps you will do likewise). Additionally, just as you do not want to betray France due to his help earlier, so I do not want to betray Italy (who has been a staunch ally).\n\nWhere would you invision the final borders being?\r\n4 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: The way things stand I have a good shot for a 2-way draw with FRA in the end. You have all deadlocked yourself and I can't see how anyone can actually make any move, in any direction.\n\nI'm not really sure if there's much I can really offer at that stage, the simple fact is that we have a deadlock ourselves with RUS, where you are neither taking him out nor letting me take him out.\n\nIf you have a specific suggestion I'd be happy to hear it, but I see no reason to change course now. Bulk up or you'll die, this is my only advice at this stage.\r\n",

I appreciate your explanation, and I understand your discomfort with Austria's rather unjustified stance. I can certainly engage Austria in accepting an unequal peace settlement, but let us settle some things first.\n\nHow exactly do you plan to employ your three fleets, if not to break through Ionian?

For some reason I entered 'send' instead of enter. Anyway) I understand Russia might fall apart if England pushes in, but right now I'd say Germany is the one at pains. I mean, thanks to some inadequate orders last season, Russia can conceivably take Munich in the Spring. Who knows what may happen then?\n\nBut, more importantly, regarding Austria... While I get your frustration, and would likely behave just as you're doing, in trying to guarantee a favourable peace settlement, suited to the circumstances, I can also understand why Austria would be reluctant to accept one.\n\nNot the terms. I'm complete agreement with you that anything agreed with Austria must take in account the positions you now command. But, even if I were to persuade Austria of that, how is Austria to trust you actually intend to move against Russia? As it stands, anyone with minimum knowledge of the rules would look at the board and assume you to be headed against Austria and against me.\n\nWhy, and how, would Austria believe otherwise?\n\nIf we can answer these questions, I'm more than eager to work towards ever-elusive peace in the Balkans!\r\n",

Can you support Aegean to Ionian with Greece?\n\nYou can take Trieste back easily now. The only question is whether to let Italy take Venice, or try to keep France there. I think it's better to have Italy take it. France will want to keep it. In a year or so we can probably get you into Venice too.\r\n1 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: I should be able to support you through. I think you need to get towards the Wmed as quickly as possible as France is about to start bottling things up with that fleet build in Marseilles. England will be dead soon with the FG working together.\n\nWe're both at a pretty critical juncture here. I recognize the fact you're surrounding several of my dots. I think it very likely you pick up STP though if you take Mos-liv and Sev-mos. Norway will inevitably get cut by Germany in the Fall, meaning STP is yours to take from Liv.\n\nI'll have to make a decision on covering Rumania and/or Bulgaria this season and I can't really tell you so as to discourage any stab. I'm sure you understand. :) I do think we've both got plenty of growth potential right now and in my experience, lack of growth potential should be the primary reason for a stab unless it's going to be a knockout blow. With me picking up Trieste back, there is a chance you could pick up Rumania AND Bulgaria off me, but going down one and having me turning around vs. you likely picking up STP and definitely getting Ionian seems like a bad gamble. Hopefully you're in agreement.\n\nWhat do you think?\r\n2 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: Ionian is yours.\r\n3 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: Hi,\n\nSorry about the slow response. I agree that you should cover one of Rum or Bul. I kind of assumed you would. Even if you don't support me I might still get Ionian - it's just kind of a problem if I don't. Anyway, I don't need to know what you're doing.\n\nOnce I get Ionian we can talk about the next best move. I might need to go to West Med, but we also need to finish off Italy. I don't want to get stalemated, but I also don't want him behind me. Thankfully, he probably is less interested in working with France now.\n\nAnyway, you know my moves. I'm going Livonia/Moscow and to Ionian and Aegean. In the fall we might want to convoy an army, but we'll see.\r\n",

I took a little break from this game given I didn't need to do anything the last couple of turns and I had other things on my plate. Your messages in the meanwhile are much appreciated.\n\nI moved to Wes to keep all options open. To block if Austria would be coming from it, to allow moving for it before Turkey or Austria could take it, and to leave my options open in term of Mao.\n\nYou once told me your centers would be better in my hands than in Austria's, which I'd kindly agree with. Do you still think that is the case? If so, could we ensure I take Tun before Austria can take it. A/T seems heading to a strong alliance so they may be better off in my hands to help get builds to fight both of them.\n\nI am not sure what you consider, but this could be a good idea more longterm.\r\n2 ITALY -> FRANCE: You're asking quite a lot with that. You're asking me to give up and lose here and now.\n\nWhy not keep me around? If you take Tunis, you'd have to rebuild a unit and then deploy it into the Med for it to be effective here.

With the weekend here, I finally have some time to sit down and get to some proper diploming.\n\nThanks for the support hold on Bulgaria as Turkey certainly looked threatening with those three units around Bul. Interesting moves from him at the end of the day. Perhaps, he actually does intend to just let me have his centers, but likely he just figured I wouldn't try that risky move.\n\nItaly wanted me to give him Greece last turn, but I \"mis-ordered\" Gre->Ion instead of Gre->Aeg to keep it from him. I think I've convinced him that it was an honest mistake, but waiving the build seems to have really sealed the ruse; and even without that build, I can still force Venice.\n\nTough break with England taking Sweden. That was certainly came down to guesswork. However, covering Norway and putting Germany into the North Sea was the better move, as you can just force back Sweden this turn.\n\nI think we're in good shape moving forward. What are your thoughts?\r\n1 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: Yeah, the Sweden thing was unfortunate but hopefully not a long term hiccup. I'm interested to see what Germany and France do this turn; I've heard that the move to Burgundy was prearranged but I doubt Germany will back off...doesn't seem like his style, really.\n\nWith regards to Italy, you have a great shot at Venice this year, hopefully he won't convoy to Apulia. I recommended that he go to Syria, which would be nice for you. As for Turkey, we'll see this year whether he is serious about letting you into his centers. I assume he'll bounce himself in Ankara and cover Con with Aeg but who knows. What are your plans with your one fleet?\r\n2 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I think I'll just use the fleet to cover Bul as Turkey is liable to try anything at this point.\r\n",

I'd even be willing to give you warsaw in the medium term to even things out as that also gives us both a better stalemate position so we dont threaten each other. what do you think?\r\n2 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: I'm glad to hear your continued enthusiastic for the CPA. I really feel that it's the best course of action for us three to be successful in this game.\n\nYes, I think it would be a good time to move on Russia. I won't ask for the specifics of the maneuvers, but I hope to see your troops rolling in at Russia in the mid-term.\n\nLong term, regarding the division of lands, all of that sounds quite reasonable. We can sort out the details once we get there and have a clearer view of the situation. Of course, ensuring an equitable and defensible position for both is the primary goal.\n\nHow are things going in the west? Are relations with France getting better since the foray into Burgundy?\r\n3 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: let me say this... France and I are talking through things constructively... but i want to tell you a secret. I only tell you this because you and I have committed to this CPA triangle and to show you that I trust you. France has told me you asked him about my move, and he asked me permission to tell you that he's pissed at me. so he will tell you we are at war, and my answer to you will be we are at 'war'. we are working out a deal to make it look like we continue to remain at war while nothing changes hands... I tell you this in the strictest of confidence and please please do not share this intel with russia or italy.\n\nyou can tell them I've said 'we are discussing paths to peace but there is little trust' or something like that... but what is important is that France also wants me to attack Russia and working out a deal with France will be relatively important in moving on Russia.\n\nif you manage to take rumania and take gal in the spring, I will do my part in the north.\r\n4 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: Thanks for keeping me the loop about that. I have and will certainly keep that in the strictest confidence. By the way, all I asked France was what he thought about it. I hadn't spoke with him in a while, and felt like opening by asking about the elephant in the room.\n\nI got an interesting piece of press from Russia. He said he thought the move into Burgundy may have been prearranged. I didn't ask about that with him, he just brought that up as a random remark during conversation.\r\n5 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: tell france that russia told u that, that will piss off france. But u will like my moves this year and we will hopefully make a few solid steps towards the CPA dominating this board. I like. That we have been. Honest with each other, and I am perfectly.

If East Med attacks Aeg, then I'd even have the option of convoying that army to Greece this fall. What do you think?\r\n1 TURKEY -> ITALY: That would be fine with me, but what makes you think you could get into Greece?\r\n2 ITALY -> TURKEY: If I convoy to Apu this spring, then Ion could convoy to Greece with support of Aeg in the fall, depending on how things go in the spring. It would give me security to convoy to Apu this springk, yet not totally handicap me by providing an option of doing something in the fall. Not sure that makes as much sense in my head as it does me explaining it, or does it make sense to you now too?\r\n3 TURKEY -> ITALY: It makes sense, what I'm saying is that he may verywell support Greece with Serbia.\r\n4 ITALY -> TURKEY: Yeah, but he may not, you never know if you don't try! Anyway, my top priority is defending my home centers and Tunis isn't doing anything to help at the moment, and I don't see France coming my way any time soon. Would you suggest I do something else this turn? I'm open to ideas. With Trieste open, I will keep Venice this year if I attack Tyrolia, so that Austria can't get into both Tyrolia and Trieste, so that is of much comfort, but a second army will give me even more security. Plus, if I need that army at home, I can always send a fleet at Greece, it'd just be nice if I actually got Greece to have the Ionian fleet to then defend it.\n\nIf you have any other thoughts for me, please shoot them my way. If Austria does not come at me, and I do take Tyrolia, then I could use Tyrolia to support Apu to Ven in the fall, so that's a plus as well, I'll have options.\r\n5 TURKEY -> ITALY: No, that sounds solid to me.\r\n",

In all likelihood the alliance that sticks together the longest will win the game. So i'm sticking to my guns. With Turkey out the way, we need to find a way to remove Italy without it falling into French hands. I think a convoy to Apulia will do the trick, which we can arrange once the Aegan fleet is gone next turn. (but needs to be done quickly to prevent Italy joining France).\r\n1 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: Yes, you can move Bud -> Gal to support your move into Boh. Because, yes, I agree that Bohemia is a centrally important area for defense. ~N~ ~N~ Do you think Italy is leaning towards supporting France? I feel that France has been more aggressive in the past, and Italy has more reason to distrust France. A truly effective stab will be difficult in such a crowded area... I support a convoy to Apu, but not this move.\r\n2 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: Tx for Galicia. ~N~ ~N~ I don't think Italy is leaning towards France right now... and just reviewing how it might be possible to get him out of the way and still push France back. If it's not possible then we keep him onside and all work together. Priority is still to push the French back, which i think should be possible given he only has 3 fleets..... but will require edging him back in Tyrolia first then Piedmont. Will take fair bit of time I think.\r\n3 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: It will take time. I'm a bit anxious, and we will almost have to rely on missteps like France missing a turn... But it's good to know that we have Italy and Germany on our side, as small and imperfect as that might be. ~N~ ~N~ I'm going to step up attempts to persuade England to attack France. I am going to do this by trying to convince him I will participate in a double stab where North turns against South.

I'll keep you posted but likely I'll be working to free that fleet (Con -> Smyrna -> East. Med or something like that).\r\n2 ITALY -> TURKEY: Are you in a deal with Russia right now? I think that we're the two odd ones out (I came to the party late, so they trust each other over me, so I'm sure they'll eventually discard me). I don't want to blow my cover right now and attack Austria b/c now I have my hands full with France, but would be open to it later.\n\nYou could go Con > Black Sea, Ankara > Armenia and catch Russia by surprise. They have their hands full in the north so this could be your chance to snatch and grab. I'd wait until the Spring so they'll delete armies between now and then, though. And then I would move out of Aegean so you aren't threatened by me in the south. Just a thought though - I'm not dying to turn on Russia/Austria, just like to keep my options open towards winning the game!\r\n",

I also find it humorous that he has bottled up a fleet in Armenia meaning that his armies have to filter their way out through the Balkans in order to do anything effective.\n\nI'm moving units to the stalemate line already. Please don't move to Silesia since I'm going to lock it down on my side. I am moving Munich to Silesia that can be used to support hold at Warsaw if you need it.

I will, however, have to move out of Sweden if I am to maintain locations of the stalemate line, especially seeing that a breach is about to occur in the west since France has a lack of fleets to fend off Italy.\r\n4 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: Sounds good.

As for me, I don't mind stabs as much as I get annoyed by allies that miss key turns. ~N~ ~N~ I still need to see Germany out of this one, and the less help you give him, the better. I understand your concerns with my units in the north. I've been trying to figure out how we can keep ourselves safe without inflating the units. Would the following work: ~N~ ~N~ St. Pete back to Moscow, Finland to St. Pete, Gulf of Bothnia holds. ~N~ ~N~ Sweden holds, Norway holds. Kiel takes Berlin (or perhaps we work it out so you get Berlin), I move the rest of my fleets back. We can then bounce in Finland if we feel the need. ~N~ ~N~ The problem I see is that if you remained allied with Austria, that is a bigger problem for me that my alliance with France is for you. France doesn't really factor in it for you, since you by association have Italy on your side with no southern threat. If you build Warsaw, you can move that back to Moscow easily, or to Purssia, while Austria moves to Boh. It's a tough position for me. ~N~ ~N~ Of course, Austria could still be fake stabbing, like he pretended he would years ago. Who am I to tell? ~N~ ~N~ Thoughts?\r\n1 RUSSIA -> ENGLAND: OK, two things. Firstly, I stand by my need to maintain Germany in Berlin. I don't think you eliminating Germany as a power is as important to you as the opportunity of providing a land outlet to Russia. I am skeptical. ~N~ ~N~ Secondly, I am in favor of demilitarization of Scandinavia; however, not to your prescription, which includes me retreating and you holding. Let's continue talking on that. If we are to demilitarize Scand, those units must go somewhere... ~N~ ~N~ So, here's a thought we might want to begin kicking around... You really want me to stab Austria, eh? Well, I think you should stab France. Would you be interested in a complete double shift? North vs. South? I think we would have an advantage, especially if Italy continues its anti-FRENCH moves.\r\n2 ENGLAND -> RUSSIA: I am interested, but the problem is if you maintain Germany, and Italy is still fighting, France falls quickly while you and Austria potentially gain crucial ground. Ideally we both shift at the same time, but it is very dangerous for me to stab my only ally when you have three. Hence why I need Germany out of this, one way or the other.\r\n",

I don't have enough fleets, neither do you, but together, taking england out will be easy\n\nwhat we have to lock out for is whatever he is planning in the south with his fleet. as your southcoast is rather timidly defenced, he can cause too much mishief. imagine him grabbing portugal - it would take ages to get him out of there\n\nso here is what I would suggest\n\nin spring, you retake brest with paris. to defend yourself from possible mishief, burgundy should cover gascony. that way it can support brest, and still defend marsailles or even spain, should the need arise\n\nmeanwhile, spain you should think about sending spain to MAO. there are some risks involved with that darned fleet in the south, so I will leave the decision to you on that. but eventually it will be useful when taking on liverpool, and faster than building another fleet in marsailles and slowly moving it around to get england\n\nthen in spring, you should hit the english channel, so that we can break the north-sea, and with that, all what is left of england that he could have used to defend himself\n\nfrom there, we will have to take the channel the following turn, and then start gathering what is left of england.\n\n\n\nalternatively, which is also a fun option to explore, is already hitting the channel in spring - disconnecting his fleets.\n\n\n\nat any rate, those are just suggestions, and I would like to hear what you think would be the best option, so that we coordinate accordingly.\n\nsince the timezones are somewhat in the way, I don't know wether you will be still awake, or already awake, or something inbetween by the time the moves change, but for me it will be around 12 am, so chances are we won#t have much time for discussion - meaning whatever you decide for now is probably the final word in the matter\n\n\n\nlastly, a minor issue about the fairness of our deal. with england split london/liverpool to you, edi to me, we end on a 7/9. I think that could go fairer.\nso I am willing to renegotiate belgium, which you probably still hold against me anyway, removing unnecessary reasons for anyone of us being dissatisfied.\n\nwhile I can clearly say that I refuse to hand over belgium immediatly this very turn, as it only exposes both of us to unnecessary risks (not to mention that our attention should lay on england. if we give him too much time to breath, it will only mean more work for us).\n\nI am however willing to return belgium to you, as soon as I get one of my fleets into the north sea - with your help.\n\nonce I am there, there is no risk for either of us involved in switching belgium to you.\n\nI would like to hear what you think about this matter\r\n1 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I hear tell that it's [1517907] to look a gift horse in the mouth. I'll take whatever scraps you'll feed me, Belgium included.\n\nThe way I see it, England can be certain of defending Brest only by keeping both fleets where they are. Which is a waste, I think, because I can easily defend Spain, Portugal and Marseilles from one fleet. I'll head to the Channel and to Brest, I'm pretty sure I'll end up taking one of them.\n\nWe have three hours for discussion. I'll be watching this space till then.\n\nOh, and sorry for not writing for so long.\r\n2 FRANCE -> GERMANY: By the way, England didn't offer me anything. He just told me you were a [147642].

I make joke, you see?\n\nAnyway, if you feed me enough scraps to make a meal, then it's more than fair. I have no right to one after such losses.\n\nWould you like a more polite answer? I shall happily accept Belgium from you, your honourable [300351].\r\n5 GERMANY -> FRANCE: haha.\n\nat any rate, let's clean up england quickly and neatly. the sooner we can force him to disband his units behind our lines, the less trouble we will have\r\n",

I'd understand that.\n\nThe superpower in this game will likely be Turkey, with A/R at war, and both of them pushed back rather significantly already by Turkey. This turn may therefore be important to decide whether you'd prefer to help me against Germany, or whether you help Germany. Germany is clearly set to attack Russia and I'd be happy to avoid that to ensure that Russia has sufficient strength to fight the southeast.\n\nWhat do you think?\r\n1 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: Sorry, with a lack of communication, I don't really have time, but I will write you back today for sure.\r\n2 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: No, I trust you, but as I wrote I will try to maintain a balanced power between you and Germany. Even if I lose territory in this. I'm not sure about that this is good strategy. I agree that Turkey is in a very good situation, but it is very similar for you. You both don't really have enemies who attacking you and have possibilities to grow, but everybody should be careful if Germany turns fully against you, it is still a good possibilty for Turkey to go through Russia. And then you need to try to help Germany.\nBut I can understand that you want to move against Germany. I can't see now who can be the 3rd in a draw. And this way Turkey for sure has chance to be the leader.\nWhat shall I do if I would help you?\r\n3 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: Allowing Russia to fight Turkey means attacking Germany. That way he will come at me immediately, that much is clear, but it can help. A move to Nth now to take Hol or Edi could be an idea although I am not sure I should have disclosed this.\r\n4 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: Considering that I am unsure which way you will lean\r\n5 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: Happy to discuss\r\n",

I mean, it seems that our strongest moveset is precisely Spain moving to Gascony, so that we can ensure we triumph against Brest in the Autumn.\n\nMore specifically, if we order Por-mao, Spa-gas and Par S Spa-gas, England can bounce Por-mao, but can't stop Spa-gas. In the Autumn, England will be forced to choose between support holding Brest or bouncing Por-mao.

I can stall Turkey in the Sea, but how can we best support Austria? Even if Austria can't be propped up indefinitely, we should delay its collapse as much as possible.

I really need the assistance of those armies, if I'm going to reduce my reliance on Russia.\n\nYou could also possibly offer him support to Spain in the fall ....\r\n5 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: That is an interesting possibility. Depending on how much Turkey trusts me, I think the best option may be for him to move the first fleet through tun into wes in the fall, but to follow it with the other fleet moving into ion in the spring and then tun in the fall. For some reason, the Italians aren't too fond of me, but if you can convince them to mess with France for a while, I would not complain.\r\n",

So I am in.\r\n3 ENGLAND -> ITALY: Here is my answer and France agreed with slight changes...\n\nSo I have checked Italy and you have bought us both. About moves, I have second thoughts. Escape route from BEL is PIC, so you need to be able to defend Brest. Further on we will not be able to keep BEL (possible situation is G army in PIC, RUH, fleet in HOL and DEN could cut NTH).\n\nMy idea (Italy's moves stay the same):\nEngland: NTH>SKA, EC>NTH, LIV>WAL, NOR S NTH>SKA (attacking SWE or DEN,), STP S MOS\nFrance: IRI>EC (to attack BEL), NAF>MAO (defending BRE), GAS>PAR, BUR>MUN, MAR>BUR\r\n4 ITALY -> ENGLAND: One reason France proposed different moves to those was to get more fleets in the Mediterranean, so I'm cautious about keeping both his fleets up north. You could cover Brest using France's Irish Sea fleet (once it's moved to EC), meaning the North Africa fleet could stay in the Med?\n\nRegarding the other changes I'll leave that to you two as it concerns the northern theatre. However I do agree that Bel will be harder to defend in the short term until France's army moves through Paris to Pic. I like the idea of moving to Ska to worry Swe, but you simply must make sure that the North Sea is yours, otherwise we're in big trouble.\r\n",

We need to discuss the Vie/Tri/Alb problem. I can always offer support, from Budapest if it is needed. ~N~ K\r\n1 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: Sounds good - G/I is in the way of both of us, but France isn't in a position to attack Italy right now (and doesn't look to be going after Germany either, unless he suddenly moves Belgium to Holland, Picardy to Belgium, Burgandy to Ruhr, and Marseilles to Burgandy and gets you to hit Berlin to break support of Munich for him). Suggesting to France that he could pick up two centers this turn might get him to bite, and F Mar built at the end of the year would help against Italy. ~N~ ~N~ I think Italy will hold both Trieste and Vienna this turn, so if you support Serbia into Trieste, I'm sure Venice will be holding it so Italy will keep it - is there any way you can move around to occupy Bohemia, Galicia, and Budapest? This would put you in a good position to take Vienna if I hit Trieste with Serbia. I am considering moving Greece to Albania, and Aegean to Greece, forcing Albania to retreat to Adriatic. I'm also considering moving Smyrna out to Eastern Med and hopefully getting into Ionian soon. Not sure if it's worth risking losing Greece and getting it back again next turn, though, since Italy might anticipate and use Ionian to bounce me out of Eastern Med.\r\n2 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: France has been hectoring me since the begining of this game to attack germany, now that I have made the first moves I am pretty sure that he'll jump on the chance to prosper from the fall of germany.

I was already considering moving a Gal - Sil, but am thinking seriously about amending this to Gal - Boh. regarding Serbia I would be grateful if you would consider supporting my army budapest - hold. this is just in case Germany's A Vie decides to support A Tri - Bud.\r\n3 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I can hold Budapest.

This might be your last chance to open up that passage before England re-inforce from German gains. You could even have Germany take Sweden from you by retreating from Denmark. And he uses his Baltic fleet to defend Kiel.\r\n3 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: Yes, I am talking with Germany about a Northern plan very similar to that. Let's hope England doesn't think of it, too! But I agree, the time to reclaim St. Pete is now or never. ~N~ ~N~ As for the south... I think the best split would be you taking Con and me taking Smy. We can figure out how to facilitate the move of my fleet into the Aegean after we remove the blockade of Turkish fleet by taking all his Scs. Right now, though, I can support you into Con, and hopefully we will be able to move Ank -> Smy in the fall. We will see how Turkey disbands... ~N~ ~N~ What about the east? Will you be concentrating on Italy for a while?\r\n4 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: Well am concentrating on keeping France out of Italy as a priority. But once Turkey is done, might be able to think about grabbing Italy for myself. If we can hold France this turn, then I think there could be room to smash through him into the West Med. He's very light on fleets and if we can breakthru to Tyrrh then the whole game opens up. ~N~ ~N~ Your support to Const. would be appreciated - though plan b might to that you take all of Turkey and I take Rumania instead. Easier for us both to defend our gains then. Just a thought.\r\n5 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: Yes, I like the idea of you taking Rum while I take Con and Smy.

So, what I really think is that I have maybe three turns of spirited defense left to me...thoughts?\r\n2 FRANCE -> ITALY: I am worried about the possible Juggernaut with Russia and Turkey, but I don't think you're out of the game yet.\n\nAs I always say: When in doubt, do what's going to piss Germany off the most ;) That is, get on Russia's good side as much as possible and convince him to work with you rather than Turkey. There are seemingly good reasons... like the fact that Turkey is building armies rather than fleets, or the fact that Turkey is naturally pinned into the corner, or that you can probably hold Turkey back for quite a while by holding Ionian and Trieste. Turkey's not in a great position either, I'm not so sure Russia wouldn't consider a stab. I do think you still have a shot, but it's going to take some good tactics and some luck.\n\nRegardless, I bet you'll hold the Ionian for a while at least, I'm moving Marseilles back into Spain.\r\n3 ITALY -> FRANCE: Thanks! There may be some openings in the East. I am in touch with Russia and have told him I am open to almost any cooperative option. I desperately need to get a build, however, to stay relevant in this game. I appreciate having the fleet retreated. Good luck!\r\n",

I don't think it's possible to say \"how things will play out\" until we see how Austria reacts to fighting the three of us. I have no desire to Jugg, I expect Russia to have some major trouble in the North so he shouldn't be too hard to fight once I've grown a little.\r\n",

I want DEN this turn and this was always the original plan made with England, so I find it a bit funny that he is trying to change that a little bit now, I see no problem with giving him HOL etc once we have done the damage to Germany. However I do think that the I/E situation will need to be dealt with soon enough, as I highly doubt Italy will move East.\r\n1 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: Yes. And I have two different feelings about Den. If you allow him to take Den he will have more one fleet and a dominant position on the West and this is risky. But if he don&t have where to find a new build, my centers will start to look really tempting.\nI do believe he won&t try nothing on this turn, but I have been wrong so many times in this game.....\r\n2 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: No I think you will be safe this turn for sure, it's too short a time space to make a concrete agreement with Italy but guaranteed he will attack you soon enough.

Who's idea was it to say to me about letting England have DEN, yours or his?\r\n3 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: I really don&t get exactly what your question is about Den. I asked England about Den and he told me that he will support you but this will make him have no builds if he support me into Bel. We talk a little about the global situation (if you can really hold Rum, etc) and he told me he will talk with you about that.\nThat&s why I asked you, as it&s important to me to know if England will get a build or not (like I said, I am not sure what&s the best option to me, but I want to prepare accordingly).\nOf course to England I told that a build for him will be awesome for our alliance.....\r\n4 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: I was just curious because England tried selling it to me like you were the one who asked him to ask me to give him DEN and I just wanted to see if that was the actual case or not.\r\n5 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: Like I said, I told him that it would be great if he can have another fleet against Italy, but I didn&t \"ask him to ask you\", but I understand he uses this as an argument.\nAlso, he got a little worried you feel \"bad\" about attacking Germany.\r\n",

        "intent_dialogue": "0 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: What I have just sent to Russia and France:\n\nAustria and I are talking frantically with France to try and get him to stop assisting Germany to the win.\n\nThat, frankly, was the outcome I hadn't expected. I had expected F and G to be fighting, whilst, honestly, Austria and I eventually removed you two, leading to a joint alliance against one of the two bigger powers, leading to a 3 way draw with A/I and one of F and G.,\n\nThe stab by Germany, yet with France assisting, has left me gobsmacked - I never expected that, especially as, in league play, he gets no points for a second place to a win.\n\nAustria and I now have no choice - we have to work with everyone left - you, me and him, to try and achieve a draw. France will, I think, work with us as he has said he will switch sides as long as he can guarantee particpating in a draw that leaves him surviving.\n\nI think a blockade is workable here. Moscow and Sev support each other, Ukraine supports Warsaw, Gal supports Warsaw, Rum supports Gal, Vienna and Tyrolia support each other, Venice works with Rome, whilst Adriatic, Ionian, Mars, MAO, Tunis fleets can set up a blockade in the west.\n\nSmyrna, Sev and Bul can take down the remains of Turkey, leading to an extra unit for Italy and Russia to assist in stalemate duties.\n\nFrance, Austria, Russia and Italy work for a five way draw with Germany - eminently achievable, as the stalemate line is already there in most places.\n\nI'm copying this to all parties - France, Austria and Russia (to who this message was originally written).\n\nI seriously think this will work. Otherwise, we just limply hand the win to Germany, and concede defeat in the League season after just two games, as a win in the last two games is unlikely...\r\n1 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Trying to persuade France, but it's not looking good. I'll paste you my chat to him if you want?\r\n2 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Sure, sounds good.\n\nThe insanity of France's moves make me wonder if it's not actually an inter-game agreement (he'll throw this one for [432255], and then [432255] will do likewise in a later game). Otherwise, it just makes no sense.\r\n3 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I realise this - here's his press to me, then mine to him:\n\nI admire your persistence and the attention you have given this plan. There are several problems, however, the foremost being the size of this operation. You want a grand alliance, and while it is a goal to remain in the game and have a chance at a draw, getting five players to hold together is difficult, especially when splitting between fewer players yields more points. At six centres, Austria is not so far behind that a split with Germany wouldn't be a bad thing. That is one thought.\n\nFor my personal position, Germany can would not have to do much to dispose of me. Yes, you and Austria can send your forces to assist me, but then we have a long game of defense against the German fleet, which has no one to attack but me, and I be down to just the Iberian. That this is my own fault is not lost on me, but I was trying a novel tactic which did not work.\n\nUltimately, and this is really my driving criteria in evaluating this, is that a five way draw is not as helpful in the long term for the league. It is not lost in the second game, as you said. [432255] is a new player, so a solo is 12 points total for him. [1038194], PB, and I think [1134393] took 3 points each last game. A five way split gives us each 2.4 points, or something like that, upping their total. Motivation wise, it make the next few games more appealing for them to group together to try for the top three spots, together, with tight competition for the forth. It's just logical, since it serves their mutual benefit. Not that I am accusing them of playing that way, but it's something I consider. I am not just letting Germany win, but I am not in the right position to strike, and I am detest playing a purely defensive game for the sake of a five way draw. If it is down to three or four of us, then that makes more sense to me.\n\nI appreciate your efforts in trying to orchestrate the alliance, and I don't mean to be rude, since I hate to see my own plans fall through. But for the moment, I am not going to go along with it. I tell you that up front, rather than lead you on.\n03:58 PM Oh balls - that didn't send!\n\nI sent you a very long email message and it didn't send - I'll type again, as it's worth sending.\n04:55 PM Right, that didn't send properly, so here goes.\n\nFirstly, the size isn't an issue. We are already on the stalemate line all along the eastern front down to Switzerland. The only place it is not in place is around Spain and West Med. With your fleets in Tunis, in MAO, Mars, and our fleets in Ionian/Adr, it will be easy to set up a stalemate line that will last.\n\nIf it's a long defence, so what? Key here is not to let Germany win. You say that you will benefit from letting [432255] win. This is just wrong!! Let me lay out the two tables & firstly if [432255] wins, then if we obtain a draw:\n\n[432255] wins:\n\n[432255] 12\nTGM 4\n[1038194] 4\n[1052172] Bear 4\n[244023] 0\n[651562] 0\n[1134393] 0\n\n\nAnd if it's a draw:\n\nTGM 6.4\n[1038194] 4\n[1052172] Bear 4\n[432255] 2.4\n[244023] 2.4\n[156027] 2.4\n[1134393] 2.4\n\n\nIn other words, if you go for the draw, you are only 4 points behind the leader, and 1.6 points behind second place. If you let Germany win, you will be 12 points behind the leader, and 4 points behind second place, on equal 4th.\n\nClearly, it makes sense to go for the draw, especially as 2 of the players who drew in the first game & [1038194] and [1052172] bear, will be knocked out in game 2 before a possible draw.\n\nYes, a five way draw isn't pretty, but it's in your and our best interests here. You can't win, so go for the draw.\n\nHere are 5 good reasons for changing your mind:\n\n1. Doing the stalemate line in the west is easy & we have the fleets to do it\n2. Doing the stalemate line in the east is easy & it's there already\n3. Germany will have a long stalemate line to defend.\n4. Germany can get to 16 units (with the 3 English centres) but no further & guaranteed draw.\n5. If you go for the draw, it will ensure you get points, rise up the league table, and improve your personal statistics with a draw, not a defeat.\r\n4 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Am moving to Venice from ADR - if you can support, that would help. France isn't going to help.\r\n5 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I could, but then if we forced him out he could retreat to Trieste.\r\n",

Could we agree to not attack each other's territories and instead co-operate against the Russian?\r\n1 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: I agree not to attack you or move onto your territory. I also volunteer to get out of Tyrolia as soon as I can make Italy either submit to a Ionian DMZ or I own Venice. I'm sure you won't mind either of those results.\n\nAs for moving on Russia, I cannot do that yet because that would be my death. He and Italy would tag-team me into oblivion. Currently Russia thinks I'm an honest bloke, and I don't want to waste that sentiment just yet.\n\nI think it would be beneficial if you focus on Russia while I focus on Italy. However, if Turkey helps me against an Italian attack, I would gladly reciprocate him. He doesn't trust me for obvious reasons, but a word from you may help him not be persuaded by Italy. A strong Turkey is in your best interest against Russia, and I'm willing to defend and support Turkey.\r\n2 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: Thank you. As usual, it's great to work with you. I will naturally have to focus on Russia, and I appreciate your non-aggression in the south. Good luck with your campaigns, and when you can vacate Tyrolia, know that I will respect that demilitarized zone. Thank you for your cooperation and good-natured diplomacy.\n\nRegards,\nGermany\r\n",

Russia quickly moved in for the kill. :(\r\n7 GERMANY -> GERMANY: It wasn't until late Autumn 1902 that England agreed to ally, I need to ally quicker.\r\n8 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: You make a compelling offer.

I'd like for us to agree to a set of moves this season so we can both see that we are indeed interested in working together long-term, so think on that a bit for now and feel free to propose some moves for this season to get the ball rolling, I'll propose some moves myself within those 12 hours.\r\n1 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: PS - What's the deal with Turkey? I assume you two are aligned or at least seriously considering it. I'd like to see you move on him to show you are really interested in working with me. Any thoughts on that?\r\n2 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: Okay, I'm not seeing a whole lot that I can propose to you at the moment. It is pretty clear to me that you and the Turk are aligned, so unless you work with me against Turkey, or move against Turkey in some what, I will assume you are still against me. I think actions will speak louder than words, though I am open to ideas you may have for this season and beyond, so let me know if you have any thoughts on that front.\r\n3 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: Hmmm, you are MUCH too quiet. You have failed another test of mine, though this time I have the time to follow up on the situation before it's too late! ;-)\n\nIn case you haven't noticed, the F/G is well on it's way, England only has two units and will be surrounded and dead very quickly. My personal opinion is the the F/G is the most powerful alliance this game has to offer, especially since it isn't as obvious as the R/T. Anyway, the longer there is chaos in the southeast, the higher the chances of the F/G taking over this game and killing all of us in the southeast, you agree with that don't you?!\n\nMy earlier statements about an Eastern Triple were 100% sincere, especially in a WTA 14,000 pot game! We need to kill off the Turk and get ready to defend against the German ASAP while Italy stalemates the Frenchman in the Med before it's too late and we all lose our 2,000 points and Ghost-rating, in my opinion.\n\nThe move to Gal was defensive when you refused to communicate earlier, but here's what I propose. Aeg hits Con to allow Italy to take Smy and build a fleet to slow down the Frenchman. Serb attacks Bul with support from Rum while Bud supports hold at Gal to see if you will work with me. If you do work with me, I will vacate Gal next season. How does that sound?\n\nI'd ask Sev to attack Black Sea to increase the odds of me getting Bul, but I'm sure that would freak you out and send red flags for an attack on Rum. That said, I think you can convince the Turk to have Black Sea support hold at Rum (or have Black Sea support hold at Bul while Bul supports hold at Rum, though in this case Sev would be needed to hit Black Sea for me to get Bul, which I understand may be too risky for you and you'd prefer to merely see me follow through with what I say I will do first... but I trust your judgement and ability to take advantage of the Turk if you want to do so).\n\nAnyway, to summarize. I'm really hoping we can get an Eastern Triple going. The Italian is already getting pushy about getting Greece, supposedly so he can defend against the Frenchman, but with how buddy-buddy those two's moves were last season, I have a sneaking suspicion he may have cut a deal with France and may join the F/G in a Western Triple, which is an even bigger argument for the two of us to stick together. Oops, I digressed a bit there! ANYWAY, to be clear, and to follow up on another earlier point I made and was sincere about, I'd like the two of us to agree on moves this season so we can both see we are interested in working together and surviving this game. In that spirit, here are my orders:\n\nBud support hold at Gal. Serb to Bul, Alb to Gre and Aeg to Con.\n\nAgain, if/when you can help get me into Bul, I will vacate Galicia and hope you will join me in advancing on the German to slow down the F/G. I will also need to defend from a possible Italian stab as his units are sort of surrounding me and he will get a build that may very well be used against me while he maintains peace with France. My hope is that a little communication (or a lot!) is all the two of us need to have a game-long alliance with the goal being surviving this huge pot game. Are you with me?! :-)\r\n4 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: sorry, traveling, will be online in an hour or two\r\n",

France wanted additional fleet help with Italy, so I said I'd ask you about it since I am supporting Bur into Bel (so France can build an army in Paris) and MAO is supporting hold at Spain.\n\nBoth Austria and Italy are sending me messages to stab France, but I'm not a moron. Even if I weren't fully committed to the FCA, why would I try to fight FIVE Italian units with what I've got?\r\n2 ENGLAND -> RUSSIA: So, just to be clear, North Sea and Skag are supporting Sweden to Den. Good luck in the southeast!\r\n3 RUSSIA -> ENGLAND: Thanks!\r\n4 ENGLAND -> RUSSIA: No problem, THANK YOU for helping me attack Germany, the German's loss is the Fca's gain!\r\n",

What do you think?\r\n1 ENGLAND -> RUSSIA: That depends on where Warsaw is going.\r\n2 RUSSIA -> ENGLAND: Warsaw was going to help defend Germany, which I think was pretty obvious and nothing I can easily cover up, especially if I moved to Silesia this turn.

I have one unit, with which I have no hope of keeping Sweden and Norway. ~N~ ~N~ In order for me to not defend Germany, I need some sort of assurance or indication that you plan on stabbing France after destroying Germany. Right now it definitely seems more like you're preparing to attack me next, so I want to maintain Germany as a buffer.

Don't you want to divide and conquer?\n\nYou have an excellent opportunity to surprise Germany this turn. I can help by letting piedmont into Tyrolia. Thoughts?\r\n2 FRANCE -> ITALY: I'm not opposed to the idea...but I definitely need to flush it out better than that. The best case I can see is that I can be in position to take one SC by the end of the year if I'm lucky. What am I missing? Or more appropriately, how do you suggest we work this into a long term strategy?\r\n3 ITALY -> FRANCE: The long term strategy depends on your end game goals. Geographically, F/I/R is one of the easiest three way set ups on the board.\n\nIts true that attacking Germany is cumbersome. I would say just about as equally cumbersome as attacking me. But the difference is you don't have to worry about the juggernaught nearly as much if you don't attack me. A strong Turkey is especially bad as he will be impossible to dislodge if he grows further.\n\nLook at the map. Do you have a massive stab opportunity right now? No. You don't. But that means Germany won't be expecting it. But far more importantly, is there any chance of you losing anything to Germany? No. There isn't. You will slowly grind him down into nothing, especially once those fleets start circling around England. (I would suggest asking Russia to support you into North Sea). If someone helps you against Germany it will go faster. If no one does you will still win. You have the upperhand, and the geopolitical balance tipping isnt as bad as if you squished me.\r\n",

Admittedly, I am not in great shape now...I had expected Russia to help me.\nNo hard feelings?\r\n1 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Well, you're wrong about how it would have worked out better. First off, you're not going to get that SC because I'm going to be supporting Russia into Trieste (as I warned you).\n\nPropping me up longer would have given France and Germany a chance to come in and relieve pressure. The Russia-turkey juggernaut is on the roll, and you're next. What's worse, you've shown yourself to be totally untrustworthy. I've been communicating with France and Germany and telling them how closely we're working together, so they know that you'll sell out a close ally for just 1 SC.\r\n2 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I saw no signs of France or germany coming in to relieve pressure. Germany in fact told me he wasn't planning on moving east. His moves in the spring show that. it was clear to me that regardless of whether or not i retreated from Trieste, you couldn't hold off Russia and Turkey and I couldn't help you since my fleets couldnt support your primarily inland holdings. Thus, i needed to get an extra SC so that I could build a third army and stand a better chance against the juggernaut.\n\nIts fair enough that you are helping Russia to take Trieste-- i believed your warning and i guess i expected such action. Obviously, I would rather you spend your resources slowing down the russians or the turks and I would help you in any way I could if you were doing that.\r\n3 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: France has a big northern fleet, and that makes Scandinavia his next likely target. Meanwhile, Russia has troops on 3 sides of Germany, so he better figure it out. Notice that Germany and France both moved fleets out of England--i'm pretty sure they're on the same page.\n\nBut about us: I want to stay in the game more than I want to punish you. So if you can explain to me how that is going to happen, I'm listening.

I admire your tenacity - a characteristic I share - and wonder to what bets you're referring.\n\nI also appreciate the disband, and shall honour what I proposed. We need to find the ideal set of moves, but I'll get there in a moment. I'd just like to point out that Turkey, who has been comprehensibly lobbying for an attack on Austria, has just remarked on how unstoppable England and Germany, as allies, are bond to become sooner rather than later. While I said nothing, it does calm me to know my concerns (namely, regarding Germany) are well founded, meaning my choices are, apparently, wise.\n\nNow, as for moves, we're in a tight spot. There are many possibilities, and even supporting you into Burgundy (Gas-bur and Spa-gas) is not completely sure to give you Paris. You could consider asking Russia to launch an attack on Munich, in order to tie German units there, though I'd advise caution regarding my allegiance :)\n\nBut our main (perhaps only?) advantage is that, as far as I know, Germany is unaware of my stance. Meaning I can know precisely what moves Germany intends to order, and perhaps steer them in our favour.\n\nI assume England will support Bel-pic, so that Brest falls to them in the Autumn. If Germany is not concerned about covering Paris, I can suggest Bur-gas, Mars S Gol-spa. Seems feasible. The plan is good in that, even if you do not attack Marseilles or resist in Gas and sneak into Paris, they can surely support Pic-bre, offsetting that loss, while you're also weakened in Iberia, meaning Germany may fall for it.\n\nOn the other hand, instead of supporting Gol-spa, I can support Spa-gas. This means you'll not only sneak into Paris, but now your two armies will be able to support hold Brest, while only one of these supports can be cut by Germany. You keep your 3 Scs, Germany goes down one and our position is, albeit mildly, improved!\n\nI'll suggest these moves to Germany, but I'm waiting for your ideas before committing to it.\r\n1 ITALY -> ITALY: Ok, it seems to be all set regarding the convoy.\n\nI had an idea, though. Do you think you can possibly persuade Russia to enter flawed orders?\n\nI don't know how it would be best to pull that off, but our position would be even better if Serbia-rumania actually worked.\r\n2 ITALY -> FRANCE: Ok, a small setback. It appears Germany is actually inclined to cover Paris. I haven't looked at it closely enough, and I'm quite tired, but it seems to me our best option, in light of that, is for you to order Gas-bur and Spa-gas. With your army in Burgundy, there are many interesting options. You can outguess Germany on Brest, reclaim Paris, or even join forces with Russia and conquer Munich!\n\nStill, I've replied sceptically, so we may yet see a change of mind on Germany's part. Besides, I'm still waiting for your thoughts!\r\n3 ITALY -> FRANCE: France...?\r\n",

And if you're not willing to abandon Kiel to take Sweden, then I can't rely on you to cut any of that support to prevent inevitable take-over of Sweden. ~N~ ~N~ We'll see.

Tunis will attack West Med, you should probably support me in to make sure I get out, but Tyrr could do it while North Africa takes a shot at MAO and Tus hits Lyo, unless you want Tyrr to make sure you get into Lyo, then North Africa could support me into West Med, however you want to work it.\r\n2 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: MAO is the more desirable target, but France will probably see me as a bigger threat than Eng, and turn EC south to deal with that.
