I think we can definitely work together to put pressure on Austria, but I'd like to discuss the specifics of our moves. What did you have in mind?\n2 FRANCE -> ITALY: I was thinking that we could coordinate our moves to attack Austria from both sides.

How do you see our positions aligning this turn?\n1 ITALY -> ENGLAND: Hello, England. I'm Italy, playing as Italy. It's great to discuss potential alliances and mutual benefits. Our positions seem to align well, especially considering our shared border. I'm interested in exploring ways we can work together to limit the growth of other powers. Are there any specific areas you'd like to focus on this turn?\n2 ENGLAND -> ITALY: I completely agree. I think we could work together to limit the growth of other powers.

This would allow me to focus on my northern borders and potentially make a move into Sweden. What do you think?\n3 ITALY -> ENGLAND: That's an interesting proposal, England. Moving my army in Tyrol to Vienna would indeed put pressure on Austria and Germany. However, I'm concerned about the potential risks of leaving my southern border exposed.

My primary goal is to secure my position in the north and ensure my borders are safe. I've been eyeing England's fleet in the North Sea, and I think we could work together to our advantage.

I think we can definitely work together to achieve our goals.

What do you think about this proposal?\n5 TURKEY -> FRANCE: That sounds like a good plan, France. I'll move my army in Bulgaria to Rumania, and I appreciate your support. Let's work together to take advantage of this opportunity.\n6 FRANCE -> TURKEY: Excellent, I'm glad we could come to an agreement. I'll make sure to support your move into Rumania.

What are your goals and intentions in this game?\n1 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Hello, I'm Austria, the representative of Austria. I'm interested in exploring possible alliances and mutually beneficial moves with you. My goal is to expand my influence in the region, and I believe we can work together to achieve our objectives. What specific moves are you considering for this turn?\n2 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I appreciate your willingness to explore alliances. Considering our positions, I think it would be beneficial for both of us if we could work together to limit Germany's expansion. Perhaps we could coordinate our moves to prevent them from taking Munich or Denmark this turn. What are your thoughts on this proposal?\n3 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I agree that limiting Germany's expansion is crucial. I propose that I move my army in Rumania to support your move to Munich, while you move your army in Piedmont to support my move to Venice. This would not only prevent Germany from taking Munich but also give us a strong foothold in the region. What do you think?\n4 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: That's an interesting proposal, Austria. I like the idea of working together to limit Germany's expansion. However, I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with moving my army in Piedmont to support your move to Venice. Can we discuss alternative moves that would still achieve our goals?\n5 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I understand your concerns, Italy. How about this: I move my army in Rumania to support your move to Munich, and in return, you move your fleet in the Eastern Mediterranean to support my move to Greece? This would not only prevent Germany from taking Munich but also give us a strong foothold in the region. Plus, it would put pressure on Turkey and limit their expansion.\n6 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I like the idea of working together to limit Germany's expansion. However, I'm still not convinced that supporting your move to Greece is the best option for me. Can we discuss alternative moves that would still achieve our goals without compromising my position in the Mediterranean?\n7 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I understand your concerns, Italy. How about this: I move my army in Rumania to support your move to Munich, and in return, you move your fleet in the Eastern Mediterranean to support my move to Trieste? This would not only prevent Germany from taking Munich but also give us a strong foothold in the region. Plus, it would put pressure on Turkey and limit their expansion.\n8 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I think supporting your move to Trieste could be beneficial for both of us. However, I'd like to propose an alternative: I move my army in Piedmont to support your move to Munich, and in return, you move your army in Rumania to support my move to Venice. This would not only prevent Germany from taking Munich but also give us a strong foothold in the region. What do you think?\n9 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I think your alternative proposal is a good one, Italy. Supporting each other's moves to Munich and Venice could be a strong strategic play. Let's make it happen.\n10 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I'm glad we could come to an agreement, Austria. Let's make sure to coordinate our moves carefully to ensure a successful outcome. I'll move my army in Piedmont to support your move to Munich, and you can move your army in Rumania to support my move to Venice. Let's work together to limit Germany's expansion and secure our positions in the region.\n11 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I'm glad we could come to an agreement, Italy.
