As France, I'm particularly interested in exploring opportunities in the north, perhaps we could discuss ways to work together to limit German expansion?\"\n",

I'm not particularly interested in discussing alliances with France at this point, as I'm more focused on securing my own borders. However, I do think it's interesting that you mention limiting German expansion. As England, I have a natural rival in Germany, and I'd be happy to discuss ways we could work together to keep them in check. But first, I'd like to propose a more pressing matter - have you considered the Italian situation? They're in a prime position to expand, and it would be beneficial for both of us if we could come to some sort of agreement with them. Perhaps we could discuss a potential deal with Italy that would secure our borders and limit German growth?\"\n",

Meanwhile, I'd like to propose a move that could benefit both of us - if you were to move your fleet in the North Sea to the English Channel, it would put pressure on Germany and limit their expansion options.
