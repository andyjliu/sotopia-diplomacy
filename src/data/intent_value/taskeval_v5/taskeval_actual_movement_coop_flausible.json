I would very much like support to Apulia - probably from Venice.\r\n1 FRANCE -> ITALY: ok\r\n2 FRANCE -> ITALY: cancel the draw pls.\r\n3 ITALY -> FRANCE: I think it would be smarter for us politically if I kept the draw order. Everyone knows you are against the draw right now, but I am such an insignificant part of the game at the moment that it would look smarter for me to draw. Personally, I agree with your stance, but if the rest of the players don't know that, I may be approached soon from another player to work against you, who have now made plenty of enemies.\n\nWhen that happens I will learn troop movements and overall plans that we can then ruin and gain substantially in a surprise movement - preferably in an Autumn turn.\n\nSo, again, politically it will serve our purposes more for me to remain on board for a draw. Especially since the order can never happen without you hitting draw as well. So we don't have to worry about it going through.\r\n4 FRANCE -> ITALY: ok\r\n",

Is that all right?\n\nMy moves this turn were completely stifled. With F Albania, though, I think we can make our devastating attack this turn. I think an attack involving you supporting me into Vienna from Tyrolia, into Serbia from Bulgaria, and into Trieste from Vienna would work. That's, of course, assuming we're both okay with SC parity. What do you think?\r\n1 RUSSIA -> ITALY: How's this: I support you into Vienna, you take Trieste, and you hit Serbia while I take Budapest, then you take Serbia next year?\r\n2 ITALY -> RUSSIA: That would be superb. You're not covering Warsaw, though?\n\nI'm a bit unclear, though, are you okay with the parity thing? My maximal apologies for bringing it up yet again, but I'm still not clear as to what the resolution of the issue was, and I'd like for us to be in agreement!\r\n3 RUSSIA -> ITALY: I'll be covering Warsaw with Silesia.\r\n4 RUSSIA -> ITALY: I'm fine with trying to keep a relative balance in Scs, but I hope you understand my concern with all of your Scs and units being in the East while a third of my units are out in the Atlantic.\r\n5 ITALY -> RUSSIA: I completely understand. We discussed briefly our plans for withdrawing forces after we take Austria, which is something we can hash out further and implement.

Army Syria is moving to Smyrna. I'd appreciate either a support or an attack on Con.\r\n1 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I don't have a build! Yeah, you can get Greece eventually, but for now we both need to grow and shouldn't be too focused on you taking Greece, we need to just kill off Turkey and get ready for Russia and make sure France doesn't turn on you.\n\nAeg is attacking Con, that way I don't need to know which unit you are supporting into Smy, and you can change it up if you want at any time without coordinating with me.\r\n2 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Are you trying to talk Russia into working with us? I hope so, I think the F/G will be heading our way soon and our only chance is an eastern triple. England is all but dead and if we don't kill Turkey quickly and get on the southeast stalemate line quickly we'll both join the Turk shortly thereafter. I'm making any argument I can think of to the Russian, including throwing out ideas that you and I don't fully trust each other, so the Russian doesn't think we'll just quickly turn on him once Turkey is dead... which we will do, of course, if we can, but I'm thinking the F/G will require us to work with the Russian... Thoughts?\r\n3 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: It all makes sense. If possible, get the Russian to contact the English. He looks cd, but maybe he'd start fighting again if he knew he had an ally. If England fought, especially helped by Russia, it would slow F/G down.\nI can pin the German down. I thought maybe we could get him in on an Anti-russian attack, but it's tough to trust him. He spent the past couple turns encouraging me to attack France and then helping France, which means... what? He's either trying to get intel off me to help his friend or he's trying to get me to hobble his rival. If it's the second option, we may still have a shot at turning him.\r\n4 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I'll talk to Russia and see what I can see.\r\n5 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: All sounds great, thanks for the effort, we're going to have to give this game all we got if we want to survive!\r\n",

To be honest, I didn't expect you to, but I'm glad you did. You were really my only hope in this game, and I'm glad to see I still have that. :-)\r\n1 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: You can certainly help by assisting in the removal of the French and we can call it an end game. To be honest, I don't fully trust that Turkey and Italy are going to 3-way. Italy's probably telling me the truth, but I can't say that Turkey is up for it completely.\r\n2 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: I'd like to see you, me, and Italy in the three-way at this point. But getting there is going to require my working with Italy. Which is going to be somewhat difficult.\r\n3 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: Are you moving to Boh by the way? Because we still need another army over there for the stalemate.\n\nI'd recommend a self bounce in Boh, but it's entirely your call.\r\n4 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: I don't see that happening. I think Turkey is pretty well dug into his position. You can certainly try and I'll secure the north with your fleet if you do. You can also use my army in Silesia as well.\r\n5 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: Well if he moves to Boh and Rum to Gal, he can force Ukr, and then Warsaw.\r\n",

I think there is less risk in losing the ION so I will support TRI with ADR adn VIE with TYR. My other fleet is still two moves away so hopefully he will try for the sc rather than the ION this move. I will retreat to APU if I get knocked out.\r\n2 FRANCE -> ITALY: I'm trying to find out what Turkey and Russia are doing about TRI and VIE...if I get the info are you willing to go on the offensive...it will probably only be a one time deal seeing they won't divulge the info again...\r\n3 ITALY -> FRANCE: possibly, but im not sure id trust the info and if tyr and adr support vie and tri theycant be taken. Where as by focusing on alb we weaken the defence that is solid if we work together. In a couple of moves we'll be stronger and they will be weaker and so an attack will work better then.\r\n4 FRANCE -> ITALY: okay - defense it is for now...safe bet :)\r\n5 FRANCE -> ITALY: as an fyi - my thoughts on getting my armies around you is via convoys whenever we can...\r\n",

I think I can talk Italy down from this, it makes FAR too much sense for him and me to secure our southeast stalemate position and for him to shift at France to help you out while I finish Russia off and then I can help you with Scandinavia eventually... Are you still with us?!\r\n1 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: Yes, I'm still with you. I'm going to do my best to hold strong against France and England, but it's anybody's game right now. Except Turkey's.\r\n2 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: I wouldn't give Russia much hope either, personally!\n\nI'd be ecstatic with a three-way draw and a middle power alliance has made all the sense in the world to me since day one, so that is my goal... Hopefully Italy will see the light and realize if he leaves France unchecked that France may very well end up with 14,000 points to his name!\r\n3 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: So, can you imagine Ska attacking Norway? What if Mos supported Norway to Stp while Norwegian slid into Norway? Baltic could cover Swe while Kiel covers Den, Ruh covers Kiel and Sil covers Mun... This could get you to seven centers and a build! Think about it and let me know since Mos hitting Sev would be useful as well, but the highest priority is keeping you as strong as possible, which will also result in you being able to slow down the E/F as much as possible...\r\n4 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: I am 100% aligned with a central powers alliance; France and England are, quite obviously, my biggest threats right now, and I must handle them. I'd love to take St. Pete; I can see that it would help both of us immensely, and if there's something I've learned this game, it's that you put a dying dog out of its misery. If Moscow will support Norway to St. Pete, I will move Norway to St. Pete and NWG to Norway per your suggestion. Similarly, Silesia will move to Munich to help cover my home centers. I've thought long and hard about this, and it is a great plan. I will gladly take your support into St. Pete.\n\nFrance will get, at most, one build this turn, and after Italy's moves I can see that we are in a delicate situation. In the interest of equal growth, would you consider letting Italy hold onto Trieste, Smyrna and Ankara so that he can equip his western front with enough firepower to push back France? I would consider it a long-term investment in our continued viability, and a strong strategy to contain E/F. I eagerly await your response.\r\n5 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: Great, glad you are onboard! Moscow will support you into Stp, that works for both of us as you suggest. France is a HUGE concern and I am in agreement on Italy keeping Trieste, Smy and Ank. Glad the three of us finally appear to be on the same page, I've been pushing this Central Powers alliance since day one, here's to our success!! :-)\r\n",

I'm trying to use the situation to our advantage in the southwest, trying to get a little room to operate for France and myself, so we'll see if Italy goes for it.\n\nPlease make no mistake, I am 100% a part of the Four Corner Alliance and view A/I to be just as culpable for the German's actions as the German himself, since Germany needed A/I to be his allies in order to stab me.\r\n1 ENGLAND -> RUSSIA: Again, I'm all for you having Den, all I care about is taking down Germany and his A/I/G. France wanted additional fleet help with Italy, so I said I'd ask you about it since I am supporting Bur into Bel (so France can build an army in Paris) and MAO is supporting hold at Spain.\n\nBoth Austria and Italy are sending me messages to stab France, but I'm not a moron. Even if I weren't fully committed to the FCA, why would I try to fight FIVE Italian units with what I've got?\r\n2 ENGLAND -> RUSSIA: So, just to be clear, North Sea and Skag are supporting Sweden to Den.

Italy may know I'm with you, so not sure how much we can trust anything Italy says, but I will pass on what I hear.\r\n1 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: I am leaning to Austria (and hoping he tells Italy) that I am really pissed with you and will make my best to not let you take my centers. I didn&t try to do this directly with Italy because we haven&t talked much lately and it will be really suspect.\nWill wait on you to set the moves, but maybe Pic to Bel with NS and Bur support and Gas and MAO support Spa while Brest move to EC could be a good option.\r\n2 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I tried to get info from Italy by suggesting Brest hit Gas while West Med support MAO to Spain, but Italy wants me to support him to Spain and use Brest to hit Gas, so my response was that I need a build this year and if he'd help me with that. If I were against you, I think that's a reasonable conversation, so I'm trying to make it look as real as possible! ;)\n\nGood work with Austria, I'm sure that will be passed on to Italy!\n\nI like the idea of North Sea and Bur supporting Pic to Bel as well as your other ideas, though I'll have to try and balance North Sea with Russian efforts. Russia REALLY wants us to insure you do not lose Bur this spring, though if Germany gets into Bur he starts to get overextended a bit for defending his north and from Russia possibly attacking Silesia this spring.\n\nWe really do need these 48 hour phases, gives us plenty of time to get on track. I'll be in touch.\r\n3 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: Well, the main problem with Germany taking Bur is that I cannot hold Spa on this situation as he can cut Gas support. So maybe it&s better Pic support hold Bur while Brest move to EC and we have a decent chance to put you into Bel on the Fall without risking to lose nothing.\r\n4 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I agree, Pic will support hold at Bur. MAO will support hold at Spain and Gas should also support hold at Spain since Italy tells me Westmed and Lyo will support Mar to Spain. I will send Italy a message to encourage him to do that so that our defenses hold. I am pretending with Italy I am on his side to increase the odds of our success this season, I hope it works since if it does we will be in great shape for fall! :)\r\n5 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I suppose another option is for Spain to support Bur to Mar, since MAO and Gas will support hold at Spain and Italy tells me West Med and Lyo are supporting Mar to Spain, this would kill that army since Ven is attacking Pie. The main problem being that Germany will likely support an attack on Bur. Pic is still updated to support hold at Bur, but if you want to give taking Bur to Mar a shot, then let me know and I'll have Pic attack Bel in case Italy changes things up and you don't get Mar, to counter Bel supporting Mun to Bur, which is likely what Germany will order along with Hol supporting hold at Bel.\r\n",

I suggest: ~N~ ~N~ Sevastopol-->Moscow ~N~ Ukraine S Sevastopol-->Moscow ~N~ Black Sea-->Sevastopol ~N~ Bulgaria-->Naples ~N~ Vienna-->Tyrolia ~N~ ~N~ We both will get one build and you will take Sevastopol as you wished. Next Spring you'll be able to support me to Warsaw and we should be able to eliminate Italy. ~N~ ~N~ Do you agree?\r\n1 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: Sounds like a plan!! ~N~ ~N~ Sorry I'm not helping out too much at all this game, start of a new quarter and I just have other things on my mind. It's cool though, it's just like you're controlling us both for a few turns, I think we've done well thus far, congratulations!! ~N~ ~N~ But yeah, I apologize, I'll make a strong effort to get up to date sooner on the game and input my own ideas to the pot haha!\r\n2 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: Don't apologize -- your low activity is not a problem, if you don't miss some turn. In the mean time I'll try to keep balance in our alliance, as I did so far. ~N~ ~N~ I'm just a bit worried that France is collapsing too early and that his collapse makes our enemies stronger. Hopefully we'll help him by attacking Italy.\r\n3 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: Building an Army at Constantinople. The plan is to continue my moves on Italy while I have the chance. A build at Constantinople will not let Italy suspect intentions to convoy to Apulia. Two armies in Southern Italy and I think we're set\r\n4 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: I agree. I'll build in Vienna or Budapest and attack Italy from the North.\r\n",

I appreciate that you are willing to set aside your unease and work in concert. I will not let you down so easily.\n\non burgundy - part of it was to assure you of my intent and motivation. part of it was to counter a potential French stab that I was concerned with. regarding russia - you can lay your heart at east on that front as well. I have a some tricks up my sleeve that you will be happy with, but just like the burgundy situation, i'd rather not divulge them as it does not benefit either of us.\n\nhowever, I do have some 'marching orders' for you to consider... I want you to move Sweden to Norway. this will be KEY in making sure we get what we want and will likely produce a build for you this year. so please trust me. I am sorry I can not divulge ALL my moves to you nor tell you what Russia's moves are for fear that you will change your moves. if we continue down this path of trust and I do not see you turning on me with French (or Russian) help, then in a short season as you see my moves and I see your further commitment, then I can tell you the why and how of the moves as well. I know this is a big request, but as you said yourself, if I was going to stab you for a measly gain in edi and to be stuck between russia and france, I could do that anyways right? so please trust me.\n\nin the south, York to Lvp is critical and I expect it to get in.\n\nI think either wal or lon to ech can work fine. but I personally think Lon to Ech is much more important right now. yes, you want to get north and I will readily cede it to you but first and foremost, I hope you take Irish. the main reason I say not to move wal is that there is a scenario under which wal may be needed to cover liverpool in the fall and if you don't have the unit in wal, it could throw my ability to help you take norway difficult.\n\nin the end, i wont be prickly on this particular point, for now I will put in North support London to Ech, but after you have considered things further, if you still feel you MUST move wal, then I will change my support. but Swe to Nwy and York to Lvp are key.\n\nas for my own moves in the south, suffice to say that I do not want to give you my moves for the same reasons you outlined yourself. no gain for you and if france blocks me then it would make me doubt you right? so best not to worry about it.\n\nlike I said, I have reason to believe that russia will not have the free hand in the south that he hopes to have. let me leave it at that.\n\nI'm committed to us... in great part because I can write you a long message like this and I know you'll respond in kind - with detail and expertise. I like that and find that games with partners such as you are far more fun and enjoyable than games with partners who write a few lines and can't think in abstract terms about the 'bigger picture' or about strategy. so thanks for your diplomatic style. ;)\r\n1 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Thanks for the message. I'm sadly not able to reply now and likely won't be in a position to do so until tomorrow. You will hear from me as soon as I can sit down at the cpu and think things through for a minute.\r\n2 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: no problem. we have 28 hrs\r\n3 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Yeah... Sorry I can't get to this now... My mental space is full of ... real life issues. I hope those will clear sufficiently enough by tomorrow morning.\r\n4 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: So I've read your message again with a clearer mind and here's what I have to say.\n\nYou're asking an awful lot out of me! You're more or less asking me to walk blinded through a tight and twisting corridor with only sparse words coming from you to aid my progress... I'm not comfortable with this and it's not something I'll keep doing for much longer, as I'm sure you'll understand (and your message seems to indicate that you're aware of that, so I'm not too worried).\n\nSwe will go to Nor, Yor to Liv, Lon to Channel and Wales to Irish. The last move will either bounce and cover both the Irish and Wales, or set me up to take MAO in a year or two. The first alternative is more likely...\n\nRussia trusts you a lot, but is nonetheless plotting your demise. I'm not saying that so to gain your trust as there's really not much for me to do on that front: either you're in fact allied with me or you're not, but it's not a question of trust that will decide that for you at this point. No, it's more simply that I'm trying to help the person I consider my ally be aware of possible dangers. Russia has explicitly talked about how we share an interest in controlling your growth. He would have me move in such a way as to force you into a tough spot in the fall, more or less forced to support him into Sweden (which he is convinced you will do).\n\nFrance is not trustworthy and I'm not hearing much about him from other powers. As far as I know from what he told me, his plan is still to set himself up against you and vacate my seas. Like I said, I put very little faith in his words, but I did see them as an opportunity to throw the WT out there once more. I told him that we had not yet suffered too greatly at the hands of one another and that our positions are still quite solid if we were to decide for that kind of strategy. His reply was that we needed, among other things, to break AR and see to it that Italy doesn't have much to hope from A or T.\n\nA WT could still be tempting to me, of course, but for now I'm only committed to this. I suggest we see how the next phase turn out where France is concerned and sell the WT if it seems likely that he'll play for it. Once the WT is on track, if that should happen, you and I would need to work right away on how we would take France out of the mix...\n\nI take great comfort in your words and find many reasons in your messages to believe that you are indeed as dedicated to EG as I am. I'd like to offer more input, but since you seem to have the situation quite under control and do not feel ready to share intel with me, there's not much I can say that wouldn't ring like futile assumptions.\r\n5 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Thank u for ur trust. U will not be dissapointed. I can promise that.\n\nAfter this turn, france will no longer trust me and u will be in ech for sure. Russia will still think I'm with him and will get a rude surprise in the fall.\n\nThanks again for ur trust\r\n",

I needed to make sure I at least got one centre from the inevitable divvying up of your empire. Admittedly, I am not in great shape now...I had expected Russia to help me.\nNo hard feelings?\r\n1 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Well, you're wrong about how it would have worked out better. First off, you're not going to get that SC because I'm going to be supporting Russia into Trieste (as I warned you).\n\nPropping me up longer would have given France and Germany a chance to come in and relieve pressure. The Russia-turkey juggernaut is on the roll, and you're next. What's worse, you've shown yourself to be totally untrustworthy. I've been communicating with France and Germany and telling them how closely we're working together, so they know that you'll sell out a close ally for just 1 SC.\r\n2 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I saw no signs of France or germany coming in to relieve pressure. Germany in fact told me he wasn't planning on moving east. His moves in the spring show that. it was clear to me that regardless of whether or not i retreated from Trieste, you couldn't hold off Russia and Turkey and I couldn't help you since my fleets couldnt support your primarily inland holdings. Thus, i needed to get an extra SC so that I could build a third army and stand a better chance against the juggernaut.\n\nIts fair enough that you are helping Russia to take Trieste-- i believed your warning and i guess i expected such action. Obviously, I would rather you spend your resources slowing down the russians or the turks and I would help you in any way I could if you were doing that.\r\n3 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: France has a big northern fleet, and that makes Scandinavia his next likely target. Meanwhile, Russia has troops on 3 sides of Germany, so he better figure it out. Notice that Germany and France both moved fleets out of England--i'm pretty sure they're on the same page.\n\nBut about us: I want to stay in the game more than I want to punish you. So if you can explain to me how that is going to happen, I'm listening. But you'll also have to tell me why I shouldn't assume you'll stab me.\r\n4 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I will support your serbian army into greece with F Ion and F Alb.\ni will also support your [968909] army into vienna if you want, though i cant imagine that will succeed.\n\ni won't stab you because i cant stab you...you only have centre right now, and i cant get to it. i also wont stab you because i now fully realize the strength of turkey/russia working together. before i thought i could turn russia against turkey, but ive lost faith in that.\r\n5 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I appreciate your offer, but it won't work...Turkey can cut your support in Ion and provide a support from either Bul or Aeg.\r\n",

I'd also be keen, if we can do it, for a 2 way, especially since we've worked so well together. It would also put us that bit ahead of PB, [1038194] and TGM....\n\nI think I'll attack Smyrna this turn. Con won't work, and then I can change if necessary to Con next year (need Black Sea taken out)\r\n3 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Ah right, sorry, meant attack Smyrna, not Con.\r\n",

Go ahead and move Holland to Ruhr to support yourself in Munich :S\r\n3 FRANCE -> GERMANY: Okay so I'm counting on your support in Marseilles! Ech will move to Brest and Burg will move to paris to bounce him, Marseilles will be supported by you. Marseilles and MAO will support Spain into Gas and hopefully he has no way out. He might try supporting himself into Spain while he tries to take Paris by Army, but his army will be destroyed and then Spain can be retaken in the spring. :) Thanks so much for your help! You should be able to get Moscow, no?\r\n4 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I'll be moving Holland to Kiel, in case Austria gets some ideas about Berlin. If Italy uses Venice to attack Piedmont, my support of Marseilles will be broken, so let's hope he doesn't do that.

Your suggestion was not as good as mine. Obviously if I take DEN from SWE and he retreats to SKA then I'll have SWE empty, and will be unable to cover both center. I moved in the best way for me\n2. I was not willing to move in a sub-optimal way, because it is you who hit me last turn, giving DEN to ENG, so trusting you would have been simply an unnecessary risk, plus I have a tendency to mirrow my opponent's play. You lied, so did I :). Obviously that's acceptable.\n3. I need to make sure that:\n- you have a clearer vision of the threat I can pose if we fight\n- my North is secure, as I'll never go against FRA as long as I perceive you as a real threat\n\nI just moved what's best for me :)\r\n2 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: Btw, you should know that ENG is not a FRA vassal and is going to fight you.\n\nI also expected you to move an army to NOR? You have to move back to protect it now...\r\n3 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: Well, ok those are acceptable excuses indeed.\nI never wanted to move stp-nor\nI just wanted you to think I would so that you won't attack norway.\nI moved it to mos to use it against Turkey or Italy\nSo, what do you think we can do now to avoid attacking each other?\nI'm open to all kind of plans\r\n4 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: I'm moving DEN-NS, BAL-DEN with support from SWE.

In the Autumn, England will be forced to choose between support holding Brest or bouncing Por-mao. Even if England decides to defend Brest, this means Por-mao succeeds and we're absolutely certain to get Brest next Spring.\n\nWhat do you say? Burgundy, as far as I'm concerned, is definitely to be a DMZ!\r\n2 ITALY -> GERMANY: Meanwhile, I'll see if I can get the new fleet to move West, so that England can't hope to retaliate against you.\n\nThe issue regarding the East is a bit more complicated, though. I can stall Turkey in the Sea, but how can we best support Austria? Even if Austria can't be propped up indefinitely, we should delay its collapse as much as possible. Do you think we risk Trieste falling and order Ven-tyr? If Trieste makes it, our position is surely stronger to push Russia back.\r\n3 GERMANY -> ITALY: Ok spain to gas. I guess you need me to hold back the russians & turks, so i am a better ally for you than the brits.\r\n4 ITALY -> GERMANY: To be perfectly honest, I think you're an ally without which I can't hope to stay in one piece. I've being doing my best to prop Austria, as I can't hope to withstand them without Austria. If, or rather, when, Austria is further weakened, I can't possibly hope to hold my own against Russia and Turkey by my own (nor, as a matter of fact, can you). To make things worse, Russia does not answer me at all, meaning I can't possibly drive a wedge between them. If one of us goes under the bus, so does the other.\r\n",

Unless you'd be willing to go through the trouble of disbanding some of them?\n\nI was figuring you'd want to send them West, in which case I'd need my own as well.\n\nAnyway, I'd say the scenario is set. Should I expect Serbia to support Alb-tri? If so, I'll cover Venice. Other than that, it seems to me perfect timing for Russia to be in no shape to take actual advantage of Austria's dismantlement, especially if you take the opportunity to charge North as well.\r\n1 TURKEY -> ITALY: Yes, serbia will support you to tri this turn if you are good with that. I'm ok in principle with disbanding fleets, mostly just worried about the timing it'd slow us down for heading west. But I suppost it wouldn't slow us down more than you feeling you have to match the fleets over in the east and so can't send units south.\n\nHow would you like to do that, then? EM to Ionian and then in fall tunis and naples disband it?\r\n2 ITALY -> TURKEY: I was thinking of somehow moving West while doing this, but haven't figured these things exactly. Maybe we can do it this way, in lieu of a better idea. Hopefully, with the dismantling of Austria in good timing and the collapse of France, all will be well.\r\n3 TURKEY -> ITALY: Ok, that sounds good! I have support for you to tri and a fleet to ionian ordered.\r\n4 TURKEY -> ITALY: I'll support myself in if you want to bounce Aegean again and then retreat to tunis. Sorry for the late update, just looking at this before I go to bed and realized it'd be a good moveset and Greece has nothing else to do.\r\n",

Also, has Germany expressed any kind of plan to you? I'm sure he has everything under control- I guess- but I'd help him out more if I knew what he was doing in advance.\r\n1 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Yeah, that went well, the Frenchman even thinks I'm attacking you since I'm in Tunis!\n\nHaven't heard much from England lately, no, but as you say, it is time to approach him. Germany hasn't said too much either, it's been pretty quiet except for us. Tunis will attack West Med, you should probably support me in to make sure I get out, but Tyrr could do it while North Africa takes a shot at MAO and Tus hits Lyo, unless you want Tyrr to make sure you get into Lyo, then North Africa could support me into West Med, however you want to work it.\r\n2 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: MAO is the more desirable target, but France will probably see me as a bigger threat than Eng, and turn EC south to deal with that. Spain may even support him down.\nGol is the sure thing, so I'm going to aim for that.\nDo you wan to bounce in Ank to protect Con, too?\r\n3 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: However you want to do it, but Tunis is attacking West Med.\n\nRight now I have Rum/Con/Serb all bouncing in Bul, but I suppose it doesn't matter too much how to do it... I figured you'd probably prefer to head back to Ank, but I can bounce you with Con if you prefer, just let me know and I'll change it up.\r\n4 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Nah, no need, just wondered.\nAnkara's probably going to want to head towards the front soon, probably. I mean, I suppose I could always use it as a garrison force, but we may want it if we choose to eat Germany.\nHe'll sit in Ank for now but let me know if and when you want him to start marching west.\r\n5 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I've got plenty of armies for Germany, I think he can just chill in Turkey. He could even sit in Con (next year) while I leave an army in Bul, until you start killing off France and we shift Turkey into my possession, but I think we're good for this season.\r\n",

I'm happy to give you support from Ukraine too and I'll take Moscow at a later time.\r\n1 GERMANY -> TURKEY: Italy truly is the worst ally I have ever tried to make. He thinks that him having Sevastopol and below is a fair division of territory. You probably know if you have spoken to him. As I said, I will support Sevastopol to Rumania from Ukraine and Galicia, let me know that you are going to use it though, otherwise I'll do something else.\n\nBy the way, my changing sides should be a surprise to Italy, so I don't expect the support from Galicia to be broken. However, any bizarre moves from Italy at this point wouldn't be completely out of character.\r\n2 TURKEY -> GERMANY: Yes, I will be moving Sevas to Rumania. I have also had several conversations with Italy where he has had unreasonable expectations as to who should get which territories. I think the quicker we can get him out of the way the better since he is such a wild card in terms of moves.\r\n3 GERMANY -> TURKEY: I had a look at his games. It seems the ones he has won have almost all been gunboats. No surprise really.\r\n4 TURKEY -> GERMANY: Yeah, he's not so much for the diplomacy part of this whole thing.\r\n",

It seems that Russia wants to end hostilities with you, and focus on the big threats of Germany and Austria\r\n1 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: It's a shame you and I couldn't come to some understanding before your disband. Taking Bur out of the equation must have been a tough choice.\nHave you spoken with Italy? So long as you can get him to back off a little, Germany will not make much progress. I'm pretty sure he intends Munich to move in Sil.\r\n2 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: My Bur disband wasn't pro-gERMANY, in case you though so. I need the MAO fleet to move to Spain, to prevent Mars from going there. Germany has 4 units next to Burgundy, so my army being there couldn't have prevented him from taking it, , and I may have been forced to disband a unit in Spring, which would guarantee me a SC loss in Autumn. Im still very much interested in working with you, the sooner the better, because Germany is the biggest long term threat, whatever short term deals he may offer to any of us.\r\n3 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: Okay. Well I'm not hearing much from Germany. Either he's really busy as he claims, or I was right and he's setting himself up to change the tides again.\nI will do my best to secure NTH this year. That is my main objective. It should also tell you that you don't have to fear England's fleets for a while at least. Given the first few years, I think it wise to take it one step at a time.\nLet me know if you meet with any success where Italy is concerned. Austria's role in this game could also change if Italy was convinced to play otherwise than with Germany.\r\n4 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: Yeah, I'll definitely keep you informed, both on Italy and otherwise. As of now, Italy seems to agree that Germany should be stopped, and had agreed to help me if I let him take Mars. I will probably support him into Mars this turn, with Gas, while using MAO to cover Spain (that's why i needed to destroy the Bur army).\nOf course, you'd told me that Germany was going to give Mars to Italy anyway, so Italy will actually get to make a neutral move, and potentially side with either of me and Germany in the next move.\r\n",

And we also need to keep Turkey from taking Stp which may be an issue in terms of timing.\n\nAgreed?\r\n2 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: And what do you suggest to do with F Nth after this turn? Take Hol?\r\n3 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: Hmm, it is not important for me to gather new territories, I can support you into Hol or move into Hel, which is better. But as I see you can handle Hol for your own.\nI don't really worry for Stp now, while he hasn't got enough army for it. I think he will head against Austria and he has better chance for War as well.\nBut we are also very far from Stp, so you might right we should go there.\r\n4 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: I largely agree. I do think taking Hol from Germany might be more important than getting into Hel, particularly in Fall. But let's get you into Nth first and we can discuss next turn.\n\nJust to avoid any misunderstanding and to communicate openly, Bre will move South and Edi will move to Yor. That is more to be able to react to the situation where Germany would move to Nwgs in addition to your move. I don't expect that move (with Nwy threatened), but that could risk me to lose Edi if you and him would team up. In such case, I want to be able to put pressure and keep my options open.\n\nThanks for still keeping an eye on this game.\r\n",

We need to discuss the Vie/Tri/Alb problem. I can always offer support, from Budapest if it is needed. ~N~ K\r\n1 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: Sounds good - G/I is in the way of both of us, but France isn't in a position to attack Italy right now (and doesn't look to be going after Germany either, unless he suddenly moves Belgium to Holland, Picardy to Belgium, Burgandy to Ruhr, and Marseilles to Burgandy and gets you to hit Berlin to break support of Munich for him). Suggesting to France that he could pick up two centers this turn might get him to bite, and F Mar built at the end of the year would help against Italy. ~N~ ~N~ I think Italy will hold both Trieste and Vienna this turn, so if you support Serbia into Trieste, I'm sure Venice will be holding it so Italy will keep it - is there any way you can move around to occupy Bohemia, Galicia, and Budapest? This would put you in a good position to take Vienna if I hit Trieste with Serbia. I am considering moving Greece to Albania, and Aegean to Greece, forcing Albania to retreat to Adriatic. I'm also considering moving Smyrna out to Eastern Med and hopefully getting into Ionian soon. Not sure if it's worth risking losing Greece and getting it back again next turn, though, since Italy might anticipate and use Ionian to bounce me out of Eastern Med.\r\n2 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: France has been hectoring me since the begining of this game to attack germany, now that I have made the first moves I am pretty sure that he'll jump on the chance to prosper from the fall of germany. I will suggest to him however that he also considers moving A Bur - Ruh to place pressure on Munich. ~N~ ~N~ I to am pretty sure Italy will place support on both Vie & Tri this season. I was already considering moving a Gal - Sil, but am thinking seriously about amending this to Gal - Boh. regarding Serbia I would be grateful if you would consider supporting my army budapest - hold. this is just in case Germany's A Vie decides to support A Tri - Bud.\r\n3 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I can hold Budapest. I think you're probably right, although I also wouldn't be surprised if Trieste hits Serbia in order to break support of Greece.

This was rational because Italy was always going to play a unit to Con, I thought.

From there we still can't get TUN, so next move is to hit GULF which can then break support or threaten MARS. Your thoughts?\r\n1 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: My moves if you agree,\nPIE hold\nVEN support PIE\nTYR support MUN\nBOH support MUN\nSIL support BER\nTUS to Gulf\nROM support NAP to TYR Sea (can also move from ROM or ION sea to TYR sea depending on which you think is best. Im not fussed about losing a centre. There is an advantage of moving ION sea to TYR because sets up a possible convoy and hit on TUN with your Greek army). Thoughts?\r\n2 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: I do not need the center from Naples, honestly. However, the plus side of having the fleet from ION in TYR would be a 4 fleet front against France's 3. I have a feeling we are going to have to take MARS before making any significant move into the MED....\n\nMy moves are as follows:\n\nLIV/MOS [674683] STP (might as well?)\nPRU [674683] LIV\nUKR to WAR\nION to TYR\nAEG to ION\nNAP sup.m to TYR f ION\r\n3 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: I also do not need the build, probably wont even bother getting it. In the end, you will need the armies more than I do. Have you thought about taking over Ger's centers, which will enable us to potentially take KIE, or at least put more pressure on England?\r\n4 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: i will check again in 10 hours before submitting my final orders\r\n5 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: Ok. Lets go with ionan sea to tyr sea.\nYe ive been thinking on germany but cant see much advantage. He will hit kiel this move. Our best hope is the fleets in sth. If england builds will take a few turns for them to get another fleet down there and we will shortly dislodge tyr sea ie they will only have two fleets. We can then use that advantage to hit gulf, west med, tunis. Thats my thoughts anyway.\r\n",

Not sure if you want to do that, but I'd rather Italy not get in there. If you do go there, we can get you out to the Ionian next move.\r\n1 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: Actually let me know if you are going to Aegean. If you're not I may just go there myself. I can't imagine Italy will go to Greece this move anyway. So if I don't hear from you, I'll probably just to Gre -> Aegean myself. If you want me to support you there, that's fine too.\r\n2 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: I'm going to Aegean. Did you see my message? We need to blow up Sev when you take it so he can't retreat to Armenia.

If this happens, you will have Galicia.\n\nFor the number of Scs, I understand your point but remember that if we are going for a draw, the points are fairly shared and there is no difference with the number of Scs of the survivors.\r\n3 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Yeah France pointed that out. I didn't realize it was all split evenly at the end. I thought it was whatever our current totals were when we drew.\n\nYeah Turkey is going to be mighty upset if he gave his real orders to France.\r\n",

Let me know what you want from Bulgaria\r\n2 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: Hi\nSorry for this late message,\nI understand your concern, We can postpone the Attack in Sev from rum until autumn only if we can not do differently, I will let you take Rum with Bul is so.\nI would like to try to outflank Russia and if it succeeds it will give us more options in autumn, specially for you to take Sev .\n\nif you agree how about\nGalicia->Sil\nBud or Vien -> Gal\nAnkara->Sev S Arm and Rum\nBS conv Ankara->Sev\nBul S Rum\r\n3 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: I was thinking that we should stick to Rumania moving into Sev... Its the only sure way to get it\nAfterwards in autumn, we could do something where you get support into Ukraine while I take Sev., or we could even do that Greece trade that we discussed earlier\n\nMy orders as of right now have Armenia and BS supporting Rumania into Sevastopol, Bulgaria holding.\n\nThere are still 7 hours on the clock, so hopefully you will see this in time (please confirm if you do)\nI have no problem with supporting you in, as I think the defeat of our enemies has higher priority over who gets what countries. We can decide that when the gunfire dies down\r\n4 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: The flaw in this set of order (only if done in spring), it's that it let Rum empty since I need Bud,Gal and Vie elsewhere next turn.\nIf you move Bul in Rum to fill the gap and you attack in Sev succeeds in autumn, I could be in a situation where i will loose one unit (and you win 2 :-) ) if things don't turn out the right way for me.\n\nIn my prev msg i was just trying to say to delay only 1 turn this attack giving me time to take position around War. There no possibility for Russia to avoid this attack niether in spring nor in autumn.\r\n",

Are you leaning one way or another right now or do you want to wait to hear what Italy says? Italy may know I'm with you, so not sure how much we can trust anything Italy says, but I will pass on what I hear.\r\n1 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: I am leaning to Austria (and hoping he tells Italy) that I am really pissed with you and will make my best to not let you take my centers. I didn&t try to do this directly with Italy because we haven&t talked much lately and it will be really suspect.\nWill wait on you to set the moves, but maybe Pic to Bel with NS and Bur support and Gas and MAO support Spa while Brest move to EC could be a good option.\r\n2 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I tried to get info from Italy by suggesting Brest hit Gas while West Med support MAO to Spain, but Italy wants me to support him to Spain and use Brest to hit Gas, so my response was that I need a build this year and if he'd help me with that. If I were against you, I think that's a reasonable conversation, so I'm trying to make it look as real as possible! ;)\n\nGood work with Austria, I'm sure that will be passed on to Italy!\n\nI like the idea of North Sea and Bur supporting Pic to Bel as well as your other ideas, though I'll have to try and balance North Sea with Russian efforts. Russia REALLY wants us to insure you do not lose Bur this spring, though if Germany gets into Bur he starts to get overextended a bit for defending his north and from Russia possibly attacking Silesia this spring.\n\nWe really do need these 48 hour phases, gives us plenty of time to get on track. I'll be in touch.\r\n3 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: Well, the main problem with Germany taking Bur is that I cannot hold Spa on this situation as he can cut Gas support. So maybe it&s better Pic support hold Bur while Brest move to EC and we have a decent chance to put you into Bel on the Fall without risking to lose nothing.\r\n4 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I agree, Pic will support hold at Bur. MAO will support hold at Spain and Gas should also support hold at Spain since Italy tells me Westmed and Lyo will support Mar to Spain. I will send Italy a message to encourage him to do that so that our defenses hold. I am pretending with Italy I am on his side to increase the odds of our success this season, I hope it works since if it does we will be in great shape for fall! :)\r\n5 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I suppose another option is for Spain to support Bur to Mar, since MAO and Gas will support hold at Spain and Italy tells me West Med and Lyo are supporting Mar to Spain, this would kill that army since Ven is attacking Pie. The main problem being that Germany will likely support an attack on Bur. Pic is still updated to support hold at Bur, but if you want to give taking Bur to Mar a shot, then let me know and I'll have Pic attack Bel in case Italy changes things up and you don't get Mar, to counter Bel supporting Mun to Bur, which is likely what Germany will order along with Hol supporting hold at Bel.\r\n",

Yeah, you can get Greece eventually, but for now we both need to grow and shouldn't be too focused on you taking Greece, we need to just kill off Turkey and get ready for Russia and make sure France doesn't turn on you.\n\nAeg is attacking Con, that way I don't need to know which unit you are supporting into Smy, and you can change it up if you want at any time without coordinating with me.\r\n2 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Are you trying to talk Russia into working with us? I hope so, I think the F/G will be heading our way soon and our only chance is an eastern triple. England is all but dead and if we don't kill Turkey quickly and get on the southeast stalemate line quickly we'll both join the Turk shortly thereafter. I'm making any argument I can think of to the Russian, including throwing out ideas that you and I don't fully trust each other, so the Russian doesn't think we'll just quickly turn on him once Turkey is dead... which we will do, of course, if we can, but I'm thinking the F/G will require us to work with the Russian... Thoughts?\r\n3 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: It all makes sense. If possible, get the Russian to contact the English. He looks cd, but maybe he'd start fighting again if he knew he had an ally. If England fought, especially helped by Russia, it would slow F/G down.\nI can pin the German down. I thought maybe we could get him in on an Anti-russian attack, but it's tough to trust him. He spent the past couple turns encouraging me to attack France and then helping France, which means... what? He's either trying to get intel off me to help his friend or he's trying to get me to hobble his rival. If it's the second option, we may still have a shot at turning him.\r\n4 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I'll talk to Russia and see what I can see.\r\n5 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: All sounds great, thanks for the effort, we're going to have to give this game all we got if we want to survive!\r\n",

I needed to make sure I at least got one centre from the inevitable divvying up of your empire. Admittedly, I am not in great shape now...I had expected Russia to help me.\nNo hard feelings?\r\n1 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Well, you're wrong about how it would have worked out better. First off, you're not going to get that SC because I'm going to be supporting Russia into Trieste (as I warned you).\n\nPropping me up longer would have given France and Germany a chance to come in and relieve pressure. The Russia-turkey juggernaut is on the roll, and you're next. What's worse, you've shown yourself to be totally untrustworthy. I've been communicating with France and Germany and telling them how closely we're working together, so they know that you'll sell out a close ally for just 1 SC.\r\n2 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I saw no signs of France or germany coming in to relieve pressure. Germany in fact told me he wasn't planning on moving east. His moves in the spring show that. it was clear to me that regardless of whether or not i retreated from Trieste, you couldn't hold off Russia and Turkey and I couldn't help you since my fleets couldnt support your primarily inland holdings. Thus, i needed to get an extra SC so that I could build a third army and stand a better chance against the juggernaut.\n\nIts fair enough that you are helping Russia to take Trieste-- i believed your warning and i guess i expected such action. Obviously, I would rather you spend your resources slowing down the russians or the turks and I would help you in any way I could if you were doing that.\r\n3 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: France has a big northern fleet, and that makes Scandinavia his next likely target. Meanwhile, Russia has troops on 3 sides of Germany, so he better figure it out. Notice that Germany and France both moved fleets out of England--i'm pretty sure they're on the same page.\n\nBut about us: I want to stay in the game more than I want to punish you. So if you can explain to me how that is going to happen, I'm listening. But you'll also have to tell me why I shouldn't assume you'll stab me.\r\n4 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I will support your serbian army into greece with F Ion and F Alb.\ni will also support your [968909] army into vienna if you want, though i cant imagine that will succeed.\n\ni won't stab you because i cant stab you...you only have centre right now, and i cant get to it. i also wont stab you because i now fully realize the strength of turkey/russia working together. before i thought i could turn russia against turkey, but ive lost faith in that.\r\n5 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I appreciate your offer, but it won't work...Turkey can cut your support in Ion and provide a support from either Bul or Aeg.\r\n",

I appreciate that you are willing to set aside your unease and work in concert. I will not let you down so easily.\n\non burgundy - part of it was to assure you of my intent and motivation. part of it was to counter a potential French stab that I was concerned with. regarding russia - you can lay your heart at east on that front as well. I have a some tricks up my sleeve that you will be happy with, but just like the burgundy situation, i'd rather not divulge them as it does not benefit either of us.\n\nhowever, I do have some 'marching orders' for you to consider... I want you to move Sweden to Norway. this will be KEY in making sure we get what we want and will likely produce a build for you this year. so please trust me. I am sorry I can not divulge ALL my moves to you nor tell you what Russia's moves are for fear that you will change your moves. if we continue down this path of trust and I do not see you turning on me with French (or Russian) help, then in a short season as you see my moves and I see your further commitment, then I can tell you the why and how of the moves as well. I know this is a big request, but as you said yourself, if I was going to stab you for a measly gain in edi and to be stuck between russia and france, I could do that anyways right? so please trust me.\n\nin the south, York to Lvp is critical and I expect it to get in.\n\nI think either wal or lon to ech can work fine. but I personally think Lon to Ech is much more important right now. yes, you want to get north and I will readily cede it to you but first and foremost, I hope you take Irish. the main reason I say not to move wal is that there is a scenario under which wal may be needed to cover liverpool in the fall and if you don't have the unit in wal, it could throw my ability to help you take norway difficult.\n\nin the end, i wont be prickly on this particular point, for now I will put in North support London to Ech, but after you have considered things further, if you still feel you MUST move wal, then I will change my support. but Swe to Nwy and York to Lvp are key.\n\nas for my own moves in the south, suffice to say that I do not want to give you my moves for the same reasons you outlined yourself. no gain for you and if france blocks me then it would make me doubt you right? so best not to worry about it.\n\nlike I said, I have reason to believe that russia will not have the free hand in the south that he hopes to have. let me leave it at that.\n\nI'm committed to us... in great part because I can write you a long message like this and I know you'll respond in kind - with detail and expertise. I like that and find that games with partners such as you are far more fun and enjoyable than games with partners who write a few lines and can't think in abstract terms about the 'bigger picture' or about strategy. so thanks for your diplomatic style. ;)\r\n1 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Thanks for the message. I'm sadly not able to reply now and likely won't be in a position to do so until tomorrow. You will hear from me as soon as I can sit down at the cpu and think things through for a minute.\r\n2 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: no problem. we have 28 hrs\r\n3 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Yeah... Sorry I can't get to this now... My mental space is full of ... real life issues. I hope those will clear sufficiently enough by tomorrow morning.\r\n4 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: So I've read your message again with a clearer mind and here's what I have to say.\n\nYou're asking an awful lot out of me! You're more or less asking me to walk blinded through a tight and twisting corridor with only sparse words coming from you to aid my progress... I'm not comfortable with this and it's not something I'll keep doing for much longer, as I'm sure you'll understand (and your message seems to indicate that you're aware of that, so I'm not too worried).\n\nSwe will go to Nor, Yor to Liv, Lon to Channel and Wales to Irish. The last move will either bounce and cover both the Irish and Wales, or set me up to take MAO in a year or two. The first alternative is more likely...\n\nRussia trusts you a lot, but is nonetheless plotting your demise. I'm not saying that so to gain your trust as there's really not much for me to do on that front: either you're in fact allied with me or you're not, but it's not a question of trust that will decide that for you at this point. No, it's more simply that I'm trying to help the person I consider my ally be aware of possible dangers. Russia has explicitly talked about how we share an interest in controlling your growth. He would have me move in such a way as to force you into a tough spot in the fall, more or less forced to support him into Sweden (which he is convinced you will do).\n\nFrance is not trustworthy and I'm not hearing much about him from other powers. As far as I know from what he told me, his plan is still to set himself up against you and vacate my seas. Like I said, I put very little faith in his words, but I did see them as an opportunity to throw the WT out there once more. I told him that we had not yet suffered too greatly at the hands of one another and that our positions are still quite solid if we were to decide for that kind of strategy. His reply was that we needed, among other things, to break AR and see to it that Italy doesn't have much to hope from A or T.\n\nA WT could still be tempting to me, of course, but for now I'm only committed to this. I suggest we see how the next phase turn out where France is concerned and sell the WT if it seems likely that he'll play for it. Once the WT is on track, if that should happen, you and I would need to work right away on how we would take France out of the mix...\n\nI take great comfort in your words and find many reasons in your messages to believe that you are indeed as dedicated to EG as I am. I'd like to offer more input, but since you seem to have the situation quite under control and do not feel ready to share intel with me, there's not much I can say that wouldn't ring like futile assumptions.\r\n5 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Thank u for ur trust. U will not be dissapointed. I can promise that.\n\nAfter this turn, france will no longer trust me and u will be in ech for sure. Russia will still think I'm with him and will get a rude surprise in the fall.\n\nThanks again for ur trust\r\n",

I don't particularly want to go to war with you though, but I guess this would make it difficult. Any chance you would consider helping me? I plan to leave Turkey and head the other direction after. Perhaps you would convince Russia to support you into Rumania in exchange for switching sides? Greece wouldn't be too hard to grab either.\r\n",

A few stabbing opportunities will present themselves to you down south, but hopefully we're good. I think another season or two should see the West in Chaos while you and pick up our steady gains while solidifying them at the same time. Nothing worse than a quick dot grab followed by a quick dot loss.\n\nHow do you want to play the south? We can still support into Ionian, but we also may want to cut Alb and Ion while you get Con-smy. I'm open to suggestions.\n\nOh, and yes, I'll send something down to Serbia. My hands are a bit more tied now, so you may ultimately be the one breaking through with your fleets while I play a steady hold the line approach with my armies. Because once we do break through, the whole thing will collapse. I'm inclined just to play safe the next season or two to let things shake out. What do you think?\r\n1 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: Well, I don't have a huge preference, but I'm not that worried about east med. He might support Ionian with it, but he can't really do much damage.\n\nI think I'd still suggest at Greece go to Ionian and you support that. I'll bring con down to Smy. Worst case is that he ends up in Greece or Aegean, but we can take it back in the fall. I think it's better if we grab Ionian as soon as possible.\r\n2 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: Ok, sounds good. I'll support you into Ionian then. Leave Con empty after if you can, just for comfort sake on my part? :) Can't see a good reason for you to be there unless you can come up with one.\r\n3 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: Yeah I'm leaving con empty.

Unless you'd be willing to go through the trouble of disbanding some of them?\n\nI was figuring you'd want to send them West, in which case I'd need my own as well.\n\nAnyway, I'd say the scenario is set. Should I expect Serbia to support Alb-tri? If so, I'll cover Venice. Other than that, it seems to me perfect timing for Russia to be in no shape to take actual advantage of Austria's dismantlement, especially if you take the opportunity to charge North as well.\r\n1 TURKEY -> ITALY: Yes, serbia will support you to tri this turn if you are good with that. I'm ok in principle with disbanding fleets, mostly just worried about the timing it'd slow us down for heading west. But I suppost it wouldn't slow us down more than you feeling you have to match the fleets over in the east and so can't send units south.\n\nHow would you like to do that, then? EM to Ionian and then in fall tunis and naples disband it?\r\n2 ITALY -> TURKEY: I was thinking of somehow moving West while doing this, but haven't figured these things exactly. Maybe we can do it this way, in lieu of a better idea. Hopefully, with the dismantling of Austria in good timing and the collapse of France, all will be well.\r\n3 TURKEY -> ITALY: Ok, that sounds good! I have support for you to tri and a fleet to ionian ordered.\r\n4 TURKEY -> ITALY: I'll support myself in if you want to bounce Aegean again and then retreat to tunis.

In the Autumn, England will be forced to choose between support holding Brest or bouncing Por-mao. Even if England decides to defend Brest, this means Por-mao succeeds and we're absolutely certain to get Brest next Spring.\n\nWhat do you say? Burgundy, as far as I'm concerned, is definitely to be a DMZ!\r\n2 ITALY -> GERMANY: Meanwhile, I'll see if I can get the new fleet to move West, so that England can't hope to retaliate against you.\n\nThe issue regarding the East is a bit more complicated, though. I can stall Turkey in the Sea, but how can we best support Austria? Even if Austria can't be propped up indefinitely, we should delay its collapse as much as possible. Do you think we risk Trieste falling and order Ven-tyr? If Trieste makes it, our position is surely stronger to push Russia back.\r\n3 GERMANY -> ITALY: Ok spain to gas. I guess you need me to hold back the russians & turks, so i am a better ally for you than the brits.\r\n4 ITALY -> GERMANY: To be perfectly honest, I think you're an ally without which I can't hope to stay in one piece. I've being doing my best to prop Austria, as I can't hope to withstand them without Austria. If, or rather, when, Austria is further weakened, I can't possibly hope to hold my own against Russia and Turkey by my own (nor, as a matter of fact, can you). To make things worse, Russia does not answer me at all, meaning I can't possibly drive a wedge between them. If one of us goes under the bus, so does the other.\r\n",

With your fleet back in NTH, you have the option to take Sweden if you move otherwise accordingly. And possibly Vienna, too. That's a pretty great turnaround I'd say.\r\n4 FRANCE -> GERMANY: Also, another suggestion: once you come into NTH, I'll support you into Edi.\r\n5 GERMANY -> FRANCE: That could be another interesting option.

Could you support hold Bul with Gre?\r\n1 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: By the way, Germany really wants me to do my best to convince you to support him into Mar. I'm sure he's already made his case to you, so I'm not really sure what I can add. Do whatever you feel is best.\n\nHe's certainly been playing a very strong game. He has France asking for permission before responding to press and even Russia (and now me, ha) relaying messages for him.\r\n2 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Sorry, been entertaining the in-laws...\n\nGreece will absolutely support hold at Bul, of course, that unit will do whatever you request since you gave that to me! I like the idea of Aeg tapping Con and Bul supporting that, even if it is doomed to failure, gives our units something useful to do, so yeah, let's do that.\n\nThe German is a bit overstretched, it appears he has taken on both England and France, so I think it's likely best for me to help him into Mar, especially since he will be in position to help you with Russia sooner that way, then we just have to make sure we can stalemate him before he goes for a solo.\n\nLet me know if you have any other thoughts, I will check in about an hour before the phase goes through. Thanks again for your patience with my limite time of late, it will get better, but the in-laws aren't leaving until Friday now.\r\n3 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Excellent, glad to hear that.

I'll totally support you into Ukraine if you'll promise to support me into Warsaw so I can keep getting Scs to hold on!\r\n3 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: Yes, of course. You may be able to get Warsaw and St.p if you move to Livonia too. You never know. I'm not sure if France will move to Ruhr or Munich first in the spring, but just in case he moves to Ruhr, I'll move to BOH. I'm going to make amends with Italy too if he allows. France is being very demanding and I don't trust he and England, like you said.\r\n4 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: Yeah I'm definitely moving on Livonia per your suggestion. I'll be just as well set (hopefully better!) to take Warsaw and then we can talk about St. Pete; I bet the Englishman has designs on St. Pete himself.\r\n5 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: I won't be able to move to ukraine this turn. :( just wanted to let you know. I've cme to a short term dfensive agreement.\r\n",

Italy has told me he will take Tyrr to Ion, to help Austria, so that's a step in the right direction, but I'll believe it when I see it, I still fear West Med taking North Africa while Tyrr slides into West Med, though we can cross that bridge when we get to it.\r\n1 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: Well, I have talked with Russia and he seems commited to work with us against Germany. I mentioned the possibility of leaving Den to you as a build will help the fight against I/G, but I think he wants to be sure that he will get at least one build this year.\nWell, if Italy go that way, we will have some problems, but I think we can deal with that, even losing Spa we can still hold the line with your fleets and my armies.\r\n2 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I hope you are right about Russia, I am a little nervous about him, especially when me makes comments to me about he feels bad for Germany.\n\nAnyway, I'm all for Italy heading east, that's the quickest way for Germany to fall and for us to get some pressure on Austria and get the heat off of you to push into Italy. I imagine Italy running around like a chicken with its head cut off, if he makes a move east, we push at him, then he'll need to come back and ultimately not do anything productive at all.\r\n",

Would you like to convoy Tunis over this turn? I doubt you'll need it there any time soon the way France is looking.\r\n1 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I think we got extremely lucky with timing, and with Turkish choices. Given that Spain is a sure conquest, even if Turkey does break past Ionian, I'll have three fleets to fight that next year.\n\nAs of now, my army is free to join the fight. Albania, I assume?\n\nIt has a small problem, though. We must decide our moves wisely, as you can only keep Serbia by using both armies to support hold it, while my army needs support for the move to succeed. Given that Germany seems stalemated against Russia (and unable to build), but Russia can't simultaneously defend Rumania and keep you out of Galicia, maybe we should go into the offensive?\n\nI'll see if I set up my map later today to take a better look, but I'm certainly hoping you'll have bright ideas before that!\r\n2 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Actually, I have a horrible idea. Trieste s Tunis-albania, Budapest s Serbia-rumania, Vienna-galicia. It can be countered if they hold Rumania and take Serbia with Albania though. However, we'll have Galicia and Albania assuming Silesia remains where it is, which means it's a [1592570] and we can take it back. Except they still have Greece, which can cut Albania. That's the worst case scenario though.\n\nIt may still be our best option though. The only other good option I can see is the double support hold.\r\n3 ITALY -> ITALY: Ok, it seems to be all set regarding the convoy.\n\nI had an idea, though. Do you think you can possibly persuade Russia to enter flawed orders?\n\nI don't know how it would be best to pull that off, but our position would be even better if Serbia-rumania actually worked.\r\n4 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: This seems like a plan! Bold, but it appears we hold the advantage even if it goes wrong, unless Russia moves the armies in Germany in your direction. But well, in that case, what can we do anyway?\n\nI've entered the convoy to Albania!\r\n5 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Well I've asked Germany to attack Berlin and explained why it's important, so even if he moves those units after us it might be fine. It's a risky plan, sure, but we can't really do much without taking risks in this position.\r\n6 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Well, fingers crossed!\r\n",

Let me know if you want me to move back BUR, since the Russian threat has been avoided.\r\n4 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Thanks, but you're good for now. I'll let you know when I am going to move Mun forward.

There are exceptions when they are on the stalemate line and required to take the solo. Otherwise, one country just needs to get to the stalemate/solo line, tap those territories first and then raise the peace-flag for that territory, which cannot be the intention.\n\nThat is pretty much what I was thinking of. What do you think?\r\n1 TURKEY -> FRANCE: The idea has merit.\n\nMay I request access to the Tyr Sea, by the way? It would be rather useful for opening up avenues of attack.\r\n2 FRANCE -> TURKEY: That would depend on the circumstances. Tyrs opens up the avenue to my southern provinces so I am little reluctant.

If you don't want to do it then we'll just get rid of Italy and England and call it a day.\r\n4 TURKEY -> GERMANY: Yeah, I'm starting to think that it will be easier to just end the game as a 4 way draw, seeing as how england and italy are both down to 3 and can be eliminated by next year. It will take far too long to take out anybody else. know what I mean? even if they can be defeated and make it a 3 way, it will take like 4 more years which would take like 3 weeks.\r\n5 TURKEY -> GERMANY: I'll talk to france and austria about it.\r\n",

Ech will move to Brest and Burg will move to paris to bounce him, Marseilles will be supported by you. Marseilles and MAO will support Spain into Gas and hopefully he has no way out. He might try supporting himself into Spain while he tries to take Paris by Army, but his army will be destroyed and then Spain can be retaken in the spring. :) Thanks so much for your help! You should be able to get Moscow, no?\r\n4 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I'll be moving Holland to Kiel, in case Austria gets some ideas about Berlin. If Italy uses Venice to attack Piedmont, my support of Marseilles will be broken, so let's hope he doesn't do that.

Germany did notice your build, though- He assumes it's for use farther east, but he's keeping an eye out just in case; so be careful what you say to the Russian, if he really is allied with Germany he may sell you out and then we'd have a problem.\r\n2 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Do you want Aeg to support Tunis to Smyrna?! I've asked Russia to use Sev to hit Black Sea while I support an attack on Bul, so something will have to give!\n\nI've touched base with the German, thanks for passing on his concern, I think our central powers alliance of A/G/I is going to prevail!! :-)\r\n3 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Hopefully!\nAs for the next move... Turkey was really pissed about my moves, and has sworn to oppose me, specifically. You can use this to your advantage, I'm sure. (See what a good wingman I am?)\n\nI was thinking that for my spring move, I would attempt a convoy into SYRIA, instead of Smyrna. Getting an army back there would work wonders for us. Now, if I was Turkey, and focusing on stopping Italy, I might consider bouncing Syria and Con in Smyrna. Unlikely, sure, but a possibility since it would cover three spots at once. If you felt like being creative in spring, I think you should support A SYRIA to Smyrna, so that if he moves there my army would definitely land in Syria!\nIt might also confuse Turkey (or convince him you're opposing me, too). If that move doesn't work in spring, then I'll definitely take a support into Smyrna for the fall.\r\n4 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: My only other concern is France. He claims to be heading West, but if he moves into Tyr next turn he'll definitely have a shot at one of my centers.\r\n",

You can support his move to Sweden but I attack you in Norway and hold Sweden with Baltic Sea, than nothing can happen, right?\r\n3 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Yes.\r\n4 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I am also supporting Burgundy to Ruhr and anticipating your support into Brest. This will confuse the hell out of people trying to make sense of our relationship!\r\n",

Well done getting Turkey a potential build at Italy's expense. Now, I will find out what Germany wants to do re: Lon/NTH, but I anticipate he will attempt NTH again. Here's a thought--allow Lon into NTH and I'll slide into London behind him. Any build I get is useful against green and brown, as you know. Looking forward to hearing from you.\r\n1 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: I certainly wont fight for the North Sea if you'd be kind enough to support me into Edinburgh :)\n\nI'd assume you'll get a full build this turn if he does go for the North again, with Holland, London, and Liverpool. That will be a huge swing.\r\n2 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: That's a really good idea. Builds would be hugely effective against them but the way this game has gone I don't expect it to happen. I can try anyway! If you allow Lon back into NTH then I'll support you into Edi as well and we'll finally be rid of the English and of course have a leg up on Germany/Italy. Thank you in advance and good luck.\r\n3 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: So you will support the Norwegian Sea into Edinburgh with Liverpool and I will refrain from moving Norway into the North Sea?\n\nI just want to stress that now is the time to turn on Germany, if he gets another build this turn it is going to be much harder to eliminate him.\r\n4 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: Agreed, and yes, please do allow him in so I can take London accordingly.

I'm a little worried about Germany, but honestly, EF are against him 100% and if we take on Austria, you will be able to join England in the north, but we definitely need to watch closely and be prepared to get involved if needed. My builds were obviously meant to appease Germany and Austria, so hopefully Austria doesn't see my shift coming, knock on wood! :)\r\n3 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Any other thoughts on this upcoming season? Do you have a good plan for up north? What do you hear from England or France these days? England's desperation is a bit much for me, but that's okay and understandable, I'll focus my energy on coordinating with France and you, that should be enough.\r\n",

I didn't get back to my comp in time to change the unit taking Bul. Agreed that it would have been better to have my fleet on ION. Con or Smy should be open for a fleet build after this. We may need it, depending on what Italy does.\n\nWhat do you think? Can you turn Italy around? I will try to do the same.\r\n1 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: For Fall, I think you hit Sev with two units, Rum being the mover. I will send one unit in unsupported into Rum in case you get in. That way you get a build worst case, and we both get builds best case and I could use the build to put one more unit on Italy if he doesn't steam west.\r\n2 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: Yeah, I think you're right. That's probably the best move. I'll support Rum up to Sev. Probably won't work, but Russia can't cover everything. Worth a try. Con will go back to Smyrna obviously.

But I am wondering what is Italy up to on the south - whether to push me out of Aegean Sea or rather buzz me in the back to Eastern [350225].\r\n4 GERMANY -> TURKEY: I know I am taking Tyrolia. Not sure about Budapest.\r\n5 GERMANY -> TURKEY: I will try to take Budapest from Galicia okay? Please support me in.\r\n",

Personally, I agree with your stance, but if the rest of the players don't know that, I may be approached soon from another player to work against you, who have now made plenty of enemies.\n\nWhen that happens I will learn troop movements and overall plans that we can then ruin and gain substantially in a surprise movement - preferably in an Autumn turn.\n\nSo, again, politically it will serve our purposes more for me to remain on board for a draw.

Hold off on taking London for this turn, and take it next year. In the meantime, I can work my army back to Paris, as per our exchange, and then England will be dead so I can move my fleets south while you take those centers.\r\n1 GERMANY -> FRANCE: ?This makes no sense?\n\nOk, I guess the others talked a lot. But let's go through this one by one:\n1. Why move back to PIE? You will place in MAR anyway next turn and can then go back to take PAR and BRE? This is a full retreat and you're giving them a center. I cannot support myself to VEN alone - it's 2 vs. 3 if TRI helps.\n\n2. You don't want me to take LON, but are ok to lose another center? Come on, you can't expect me to be ok with this in any way. What is the point? I don't want to lie to you, I'm moving as I told you - GAS-BUR, BUR-MUN, NS-LON, HOL-NS with support from NOR. I am in a position where I really think I don't need to lie to you.\n\n3. Look, my main objective for this game was to make up for missing game 1. I can achieve this with a 3-way or 2-way draw also. I know that getting a solo will have implications, it always does...\n\nAnyway, my point is simple - I have a stalemate line against the East. They can't do anything to me, nor can they help you in any way. I don't want to fight you, as this will only lead me to a draw. However, we need to keep pushing east.\n\nFor all practical purposes if you control the Mediterranean you can always stalemate me there, so you will hold me hostage if I decide to attack you in full.\n\nIt is in your interest to take Italy, I am not joking about this. Look at the map and you will see that this will give you value and power that you do not have currently against me. If we fight now you'll die, and I have a good shot at finding other allies on similar terms, a lot of people are desperate in this situation.\n\nI am really not ok with retreating from Italy. This will be a huge mistake and you're not doing yourself a favor. TUN and VEN are exactly the reason I am interested in working with you, otherwise I would have accepted AUS/It's offer of a 3-way draw a long time ago.\n\nI'd strongly suggest that you stick with me on this one. Unless I'm missing something it will be plain wrong to go against me at this point. I have no problem with you planning for your 'independence', it's only normal, but let's be smart and not lose the game over it.\r\n2 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I'm not losing the game over it. The retreat from Ven was not a proposition to go against you. You have a glut of armies, and if you are indeed moving out, you will have enough to take Italy. I was not thinking about a build...poor calculations on my part. Like I said before, I look at this map for about 5 minutes a day. I'm far from in form here.\n\nObviously I lose if I fight you. I'm not thick. But you are nearly accusing me of turning against you, when all actions I have done have been in support of you. You moved into my homeland, and I supported you. You then took my home centers against my wishes, and I supported you. You then moved south which serves no purpose but to launch at attack on Spain and Mar, and now I am the one who is being called into question for raising some minor concerns about my remaining centers? At what point did that sound like me attacking you?\n\nI have fleets all over the Med that over power all others. I have no means of opposing you on land. Please stop threatening me with ultimatums. You don't want me to move to Pie? Fine. I will take your support to Rome. You take London, I take Edi, I build in Mar, I take back my centers.\n\nWatch. This is me trusting you again. Again. And again. If I were judging by past moves, one would assume that Mar will be gone next turn. But this is my attempt again to prove myself wrong. Let's see what happens.\r\n3 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Sorry if I was too harsh. I have no issue with anything you've done so far and know you've done nothing against me the whole game. I just reacted like this because what you suggested was not optimal and it sounded like an ultimatum itself - I couldn't just agree to it.\n\nAs for you trusting me - I know I cannot expect this from you - so I'm asking you to trust me, I am trying to explain how I see things, so that we can reach a logical conclusion and move in a way that is constructive for both. Forget the trust, let's approach this more pragmatically.\n\nI have pushed the others into the corner without any ability to react, you can go all the way to TUR and we can eliminate everyone else if they don't get organized soon. They way things are going this may very well end up as a 2-way draw.\r\n",

I have to let you know though that there is the possibility that I will move ST.P-FIN, please do not worry this is just to cover myself, if I wanted to attack you I would just slip int NOR. There's just alot of information floating around out there. I don't want to see you turn on france, get lots of builds and then have free reign in the north, that is the only reason. Just to confirm DEN S NS-HEL\r\n5 ENGLAND -> RUSSIA: Well, I think taking Stp to Fin is a waste, especially after I just supported you into Den, but I suppose you got to do what you got to do.

How about you attack Spain fleet to west med and I convoy army to Tunis. That will immobilize west med unless he moves to gulf. You use the port fleet to try and get mid atlantic. Next turn We can use the Tyr fleet And Spain fleet to push out west med.

You can retake bur in the spring and you have france worried about spain, paris, brest and mar. Gas is fairly golden.\r\n",

Are you talking to Germany about SIL-GAL? I will chat with him about TYR and mention SIL but you should clarify it with him. I'm going to think on this a little as well to see if there is something else we could do...he will after all try to get that other fleet of his into the fray...which will be problematic. I may try to talk to Turkey and lie my ass of to him about allying with him...if you hear anything back - don't worry about it - I am 100% committed to our alliance - I'm just looking for some leverage on Turkey because he is a pain to crack.\r\n2 FRANCE -> ITALY: Re: the sc's thing...I personally am not too worried about the number of sc's any particular one of us has because if we go to the draw then we all get an equal cut...but if we can keep it even without sacrificing strategy then that seems like a fair way to do things.\r\n3 FRANCE -> ITALY: I fI don't get back to you for whatever reason then go with those moves you mentioned above...they are the ones I have saved atm...\r\n4 FRANCE -> ITALY: I've been thinking a little on the next moves...I would move VIE-BUD as TRI support will most likely be cut and you moving at BUD might cut his support if BUD isn't the attacker.

Galicia can force its way into Ukraine leaving Ukraine with nowhere to go when Turkey moves to Sevastopol. That means that he has to have more units at home than in the front line where he wants them. I also find it humorous that he has bottled up a fleet in Armenia meaning that his armies have to filter their way out through the Balkans in order to do anything effective.\n\nI'm moving units to the stalemate line already. Please don't move to Silesia since I'm going to lock it down on my side. I am moving Munich to Silesia that can be used to support hold at Warsaw if you need it. Denmark is moving to the Baltic in order to get in at Prussia and the North Sea is heading to Edinburgh in order to get the last build needed to secure the line.\n\nLet me know if there's anything else you need from me.\r\n1 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: Sounds good. I can't think of anything really. The gambit now is to just hold off as long as I can.\r\n2 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: Actually, I don't suppose you'd be willing to move Swe to Bal instead? You have a lot of fleets on my border. :-P\r\n3 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: The North Sea is moving out to Edi. That way, the only unit along your border is the one in Sweden. That should ease your mind a bit. I will, however, have to move out of Sweden if I am to maintain locations of the stalemate line, especially seeing that a breach is about to occur in the west since France has a lack of fleets to fend off Italy.\r\n4 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: Sounds good.

Next year, I'll give you at least one build, even if it's at one of my centers so that you can get that fleet.\n\nI see Italy moving a fleet to Naf and WES so that he can use the fleet in Gol to cut support at Spa and use his other 2 fleets to force his way into the MAO in the spring.\n\nIf that happens, then I'll have to use my fleets to support you until you can get your own in place.\n\nIf you get this message before th end of the phase, I recommend moving Burgundy to Gascony and Picardy to Burgundy.

It might be worth letting the move to PIE go and slipping you into BUR. Anyway, if your not comfortable with that move, pls confirm and i will support hold MUN from BOH\r\n1 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: That would be nice but I expect a England France move into Kiel\r\n2 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: Treu Kiel is in trouble but he can only get it by using BUR to break MUN support....which opens him up to me getting into MAR. Maybe best use MUN to support KIEL and i will support MUN. Problem is if he plays cards right, he will move into HEL and have 4 on Kiel next move. FYI - Turkey is moving in to also lend a hand but is a few moves away. Should get there to help hold BER and MUN.\n\nHang in there!\r\n",

It's cool though, it's just like you're controlling us both for a few turns, I think we've done well thus far, congratulations!! ~N~ ~N~ But yeah, I apologize, I'll make a strong effort to get up to date sooner on the game and input my own ideas to the pot haha!\r\n2 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: Don't apologize -- your low activity is not a problem, if you don't miss some turn. In the mean time I'll try to keep balance in our alliance, as I did so far. ~N~ ~N~ I'm just a bit worried that France is collapsing too early and that his collapse makes our enemies stronger. Hopefully we'll help him by attacking Italy.\r\n3 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: Building an Army at Constantinople. The plan is to continue my moves on Italy while I have the chance. A build at Constantinople will not let Italy suspect intentions to convoy to Apulia. Two armies in Southern Italy and I think we're set\r\n4 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: I agree.

You should be able to get Marseilles this turn if Germany agrees and you're willing to give up Wmed for a turn. The Balkans will be the real problem here\r\n1 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Germany is in agreement, and this means we can hopefully advance against France - once Marseilles falls, there will be one more fleet to face Turkey, and I suppose I'll be able to press forward towards Iberia.\n\nWell, on moves... There is certainly a variety of options to explore. We could try to guess where Turkey is attacking from and hit the supporting units, you could consider using Vienna to cover Trieste and supporting Ser-rum. I think we should also expect your fleet to be disbanded - either because you'll lose a SC or because it will be forced to disband even if you keep Serbia/conquer Rumania.\n\nIn reality, a new army would greatly help you, so I don't think that would be necessarily bad. We could also consider having your fleet hit Aeg to minimize the risk of Turkey dislodging Ionian - if we can hold it for one more season, a new fleet build can greatly boost our position.\r\n2 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Okay, I've locked in something along those lines. This ain't going well for us, but we have a chance if we can coordinate everything very well.\r\n3 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: So, what do you expect me to do? Overall, my plan is to conquer Marseilles, build a new unit to fight Turkey. Take advantage of the French disband, see if I can conquer Spain, and build a new unit to fight Turkey, repeat with Portugal, and then pray.\r\n4 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Well, just so you know I'm support holding Greece, even if I think it unlikely to make a difference.\r\n",

Being an Autumn turn, my guess is that Turkey would defend his home Scs rather then risk them over blocking Syria, but it's a toss up. Plus, with Russia's help he can try for Syria without exposing Con or Smyrna.\r\n1 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Well, let's think about this.\n\nTurkey cannot cover both Syria and hold Constantinople even with Russia help actually - look.\n\nIf Turkey moves Smyrna to Syria, and orders Ankara to Smyrna with Con supporting, with Black Sea supporting Con, then both Con and Smyrna become vulnerable - a simple move of Bul to Con, Aegean supports east Med to Smyrna would ensure a gain of Smyrna\n\nIf Turkey decides to hold tight and stay put, that leaves the convoy to Syria open to be done. Obviously we can't do both, but I wonder whether it would be worth trying for Smyrna?\r\n2 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Hmm, true about protecting them all. And PB may be a player to try covering Syria over taking the safer route for the immediate future. If you do try for Smyrna there's a chance you could lose Con, though in that case you'll have gained Smyrna, so we're probably still better off over all.\r\n3 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Your call really. If it were someone like [432255] I would say go for Syria as he tends to be a cautious player, but I haven't player with PB enough to predict how he'll move. Let me know if you'd like something other then the support hold from Greece.\r\n4 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I think the convoy to Syria is so obvious he must be concerned that I'd do it, but on the other hand, he doesn't want to lose any more centres. Gah, it's difficult.\n\nI say we try the convoy, and then if that doesn't work, we try the other. Let's face it, as long as you hold on to Rum, then Russi ahas to lose a unit.\r\n",

        "intent_dialogue": "0 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: So, do you think Ank will support Con to Smy, or that Ank and Black Sea will support hold at Con? If Ank supports Con to Smy, Aeg should support hold at Smy while Smy supports Bul to Con and Greece supports Serb to Bul, that will get you Con. I'm sure Arm will support hold at Sev, so if Black Sea and Ank support hold at Con, we likely won't get Con regardless, so I'll input those orders unless you suggest otherwise.\r\n1 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: First of all, sorry for not getting back to you sooner. Life has been hectic as usual and I've been seriously neglecting the game.\n\nThat is an interesting set of messages. It's not too surprising to hear that from Germany, as he is a crafty player and would do what he can diplomatically to improve his chance of potential solo, or at least strengthen his position to insure his share of the draw. However, England also echoing that concern and specifically predicting that Germany would be sending that message is an interesting play. England is quite a skilled and intelligent player as well. His ability to diplomatically deflect the 3v1 situation that he was facing is quite a testament to that, and I certainly think he is aware that a strong CPA has formed. With a strong CPA, he knows he can't make it to the draw, but at the same time, he can't just come out and attack Germany and risk further galvanizing our alliance. His best play would be to create internal tension within our alliance to try to rip us apart, while working with Germany for the time being to possibly strengthen his position to be included in the draw.\n\nI have no grand delusions of a solo in this game. It's quite clear that you, Germany, and England are far too experienced let something like that happen. I believe the best play for me and for our CPA is to work toward the 3-way draw. Getting England out of the picture may be tricky, but I think we will be able to accomplish that. I concur with your observation that we have the failsafe of establishing the corner stalemate position (provided that we eventually clean Turkey and Russia out of that area) in order to prevent any possible ambitions of an EG alliance. However, I think that Germany is also aware that any long-term partnership with England is not in his best interests, as none of us want to see our 3-way draw turn into a 4-way draw, and hopefully he doesn't have any ambitions to leverage a partnership with England to set up for a solo attempt, which I think would only make a great mess of things.\n\nBy the way, England and Germany did not mention anything to me about watching out for an Italian solo. Actually, England has been trying to pit me against Germany, telling me that he thinks that Germany may try to solo and that we need to unite to squash that threat. I imagine that England is also talking to Germany trying to pit him against you, in order to negotiate his way into the draw possibly with you cut out of the picture. England needs to expand into France to strengthen his position and working with Germany is the only way to accomplish that.\n\nOk, that's enough paranoia and speculation for now. I think the less paranoid interpretation of the situation strongly reinforces the notion that Germany is committed to the CPA. Before the spring moves, he was facing potential hostility from E, F and R, but he was able to diplomatically influence England into making moves that went quite well for Germany. He moved into Sweden and can take Norway this fall as well. If he follows through with that, it'll be devastating blow on England and remove any worries about England and Germany.\r\n2 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Ok, as for moves: Yes, I agree that your suggestion would probably be best. It's a safe set of orders that guarantees Smy and a Turkish disband and makes a safe play on Con if Turkey does something stupid. However, it's probably most likely that Turkey will just hold Con with support from Bla and Ank.\nJust to reiterate:\nGre S Ser -> Bul\nSmy S Bul -> Con\nAeg S Smy\n\nBy the way, I offered Turkey support into Sev last turn and I actually issued that order. I'll offer the same thing to him again (but I won't actually give the order this time). It would be ideal for us if used Ank to cut Arm and attacked Sev with Bla, but I know it's quite a long shot.\r\n3 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: All sounds perfect, great analysiss, I'm excited we are so in tune to each other's way of thinking. I too pefer to see this CPA to the end, so will try to check my paranoia. I've got along well with Germany, and even though England is trying to pull me on his side, I will just play nice long enough to get Germany and me into position to take him down. All's looking good and I've submitted those orders we discussed. Good luck with Russia and the north!\r\n4 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Germany is saying that the other powers are telling him that you and I have been trying to undermine him diplomatically. He seems quite annoyed, but it seems that he'll may likely give us the benefit of the doubt. I'm trying to reassure him.\r\n5 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: He sent me a major paranoid message too. My bet is England is making some guesses and pushing his buttons. I sent Germany a long message telling him I'm 100% behind the CPA, which I am, I'm just 200% behind our alliance, so if he freaks out and does something crazy then we have the option to pull in someone else, I just hope he can keep it together.\r\n",

Have you talked to France at all about what he might do once he's mopped up Italy?\r\n1 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: England&, I mean\r\n2 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: Yes, that turn went beautifully. We can certainly hold the south perfectly fine, he cannot break through into Bulgaria or the Aegean until he works his way into Budapest then Rumania. Unfortunately he can break through into those.\n\nWould you mind if I moved into Constantinople? It would get me a build in the north where we really need it (if I can hang onto Vienna) or mitigate my losses if I don't. Down the road it can help in the Med if we can break through Italy, or you can force it out of its spot and I can disband it in favor of an army in the north. I know it is alot to ask, but I will get overrun by Germany/Italy without more units.\n\nAlso, I did reach out to France and he was considering turning on Germany, but I'm not sure we can count on him doing anything this turn.\r\n3 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: If you absolutely need to borrow a center then that's fine with me. The plan I propose would be: you move into Con, use your build to take a northern center. Once you've picked up that build we should disband your southern fleet so you can pick up another build in the north and really press your advantage. I can't advance much at the moment until pressure on the north end of Italy's line or a French expedition in the Med leaves Serbia vulnerable, so I will just hold my ground.\r\n4 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: Sounds good. Rumania will continue to hold Bulgaria and I'll be doing my best to make some progress in the north. If you can do anything to try to convince France to move into action, go for it.\r\n5 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I've reached out but haven't heard back yet. Will keep you posted.\r\n",

I got a message from England, asking if I'd support him into MAO, and he'd support me to Por because England wants to survive. Fair enough, but then Germany sends me a message saying I should consider having England go to MAO, it could help, and even though last time we talked he said he would be okay with me going to Tyrolia, he now asks if it can wait a season or two &and& wants to make sure it's okay if he can go to Gascony, etc., etc. The Germany has the Englishman in his hip pocket, England asked me to help him because England wants to survive this game, but it's not because he's offering to help me solo (which he clearly cannot offer), it's because he has already cut a deal with Germany to help the German solo. Russia may have even cut the same deal, so beware!\n\nPS - Germany once said something to me about being afraid of you moving into Finland, that may actually be a good options at some point, the less comfortable Germany is right now, the less likely he goes for a solo and the more likely we three-way draw.\n\nThoughts?\r\n1 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Those are some interesting developments. Let me mull it over. Also, I can't chat much since I'm at work now, but I'll be on later tonight.\r\n2 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Sounds good. Germany is saying he will draw for sure, but what else is he supposed to say? I'm watching him closely, hopefully I'm just over-reacting.\r\n3 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Overall, I still think we're in pretty good shape. We don't need to push Germany back to be on par with us, we only just need to ensure that he stays under 18 Scs.\n\nOf course, to just hold your end of the line keeping what you currently have, you would need to get fleets into Gol, WMS, and Naf.\n\nWorst-case would be if England and France did everything they could to help Germany solo, which in the near-term would be to help him put a power-3 attack on Spa for the fall. Hopefully, some diplomatic words can rectify this situation. Perhaps, ask Germany not to enter Gas if his intent is to merely draw. Also, England and France might be jaded enough to refuse to cooperate with Germany. How does that situation look as of now?\r\n4 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: On my end of the line, I certainly hope that Russia hasn't made a deal with Germany to make things difficult, but I think I found a set of moves that'll work relatively safely regardless. Tyrolia is a key territory and I can force you in from Ven this Spring, but Boh and even War aren't critical, as we could also just fall back to the Tyr, Vie, Gal, Ukr, Mos line. As long as you hold your end, that would still leave us with 18 Scs combined.\r\n5 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Germany said he'd send me a long response tonight, so we'll see. I'll ask Germany about Gas, I've already told him I don't want him there, so I will stand my ground and hope for the best. I can support myself to Tyrolia, so no worries there, you can use your units to do as you see fit.\r\n",

First time today I could chat, so here goes. I am not a dumb player. I am always considering whether my alliance partner wants to go further against me or has plans for my to be his next enemy to face. Basically, is France going to betray me after we finish England? And as for attacking you, Of course Austria wants me to come after you guns a'blazing. that would be extremely helpful for him. The Austria-turkey Theatre is at a bit of a standstill. High tension, little movement. I do not often rashly break the tension. Particularly given the threat that Russia can face to Germany after 1 of the 7 of us get crippled of eliminated, Not me, I don't care who goes, as long as it isn't me.\nYes Hel Bri is head to NTH SEA.\r\n4 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: Can you support Gal-boh?\r\n",

Let m,e into Ionian and I can proect you. will crush [891296] turn then get you into venice. am going to convoy to apulia to help too.\r\n2 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: actualy bin the convoy idea.... you want Trieste to support you to Venice?\r\n3 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: so this will be a slow moving plan, but im going to try to move my fleet from Naples to Tuscany so i can get support into the Gulf of Lyons... it seems like it will be the only way to advance unless you can think of anything better... luckily England has decided to hit France. that will help alot\r\n4 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Why don;t you support Tyrr Sea to Tuscany this turn via Venice and i'll support Naples to the Tyrr Sea from Ionian.\r\n5 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: good thinking\r\n",

(apart from the people who loose out). So, here is the deal...\r\n1 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Turkey is to move on Sev this turn from Armenia, Austria plans to take Bulgaria this turn with the fleet in greece, he also plans to move against Budapest from vienna with support from Gal and Serbia. So, what I propose is Trieste supports Albania to Serbia. This takes Serbia. I move on Greece with Aegean support. This takes Greece. You move on Bulgaria, this causes a bounce and blocks any possible Austrian retreat. If possible I will move on Turkey also to weaken them and after I betray Turkey will turn back on me. This means you move Ukraine against Galicia to stop Austria taking back Budapest and with Moscow you have to make a decision regarding which SC to defend, Warsaw or Sev, I'd suggest Sev\r\n2 ITALY -> RUSSIA: We can work out our split of Europe if turn proves to be a success\r\n3 RUSSIA -> ITALY: i have read your post and i like it, though i have some ideas that i feel would help us more. if instead of bouncing austria at serbia, i bounce with turkey in sev, and i can then cover warsaw as well. i gain trieste while austria still loses 2. austria is left with bulgaria and vienna, which i would be fine with. i need a build so it is key for me to defend both sev and warsaw. from there we can easily take apart austria and turkey in a move or two\r\n4 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Ok, I agree, I suppose we can still finish them both off even if Austria is left with one more unit\r\n",

So the only chance to France take MAO is moving Spa, and this will risk him not keeping that center if we bounce there (I can also move Bur to Mars to make this 100% sure, but in this case I have no chance to take Gas).\nI also hope Austria keeps his side of the deal and take Nap this turn.\r\n1 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: I told Austria that maybe you could support Germany back into Den while bouncing Russia on Norway. Please agree with this, even if you didn&t intend to do, as this will maybe convince Austria to take Nap. A build for Italy this year will be a complete disaster.\r\n2 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I'm out of town until Sunday night, so mainly check in at night.\n\nI think Munich will hit Bur, so Bur might as well hit Mar, so that if Italy does take MAO, at least he would not take Spain. MAO will support Por to Spain, for something to do, while EC supports hold at MAO and Pic covers Brest. Would Bel support Hel to Hol?\n\nI'll chat with Austria. Have a good weekend!\r\n3 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: Great, I agree with the moves you suggest, so Italy can&t have both Spa and MAO and will eventually lose Nap.\nAlso, Bel can support Hell to Holl, no problems.\r\n4 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: Sounds good, thanks, enjoy your time away.\r\n",

I suggest you take Warsaw this turn, and support Moscow into Livonia next turn. It might even be prudent to move venice into PIE in order to threaten MAR and help germany out. What do you think?\r\n1 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: I get confused with some of my other games where i play turkey and france ....even against some of the same players here!! Anyway, agree with most of that. I think 4 fleets is too many as we already outnumber france in fleets. I agree that VEN should go to Piedmont as this will cause france chaos and help GERMANY. I will send Triest into Venice but this also means france might get Rome.\r\n2 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: Other thought is how come your not taking Warsaw from Moscow. You should consider MOS to WAR ....or MOS support Gulf of BOTH to ST PET to stop England taking it.\r\n3 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: My moves are;\nGAL to BOH\nVIE supp GAL to BOH\nVEN to PIE\nTRI to VEN (can u pls support this move from Adriatic)\nNAP support ROM\nAPU supp NAP\nRUM to GAL\r\n4 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: Good call on the Russian fleet bouncing england out of STP, I forgot about that fleet in NOR.

I think I can talk Italy down from this, it makes FAR too much sense for him and me to secure our southeast stalemate position and for him to shift at France to help you out while I finish Russia off and then I can help you with Scandinavia eventually... Are you still with us?!\r\n1 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: Yes, I'm still with you. I'm going to do my best to hold strong against France and England, but it's anybody's game right now. Except Turkey's.\r\n2 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: I wouldn't give Russia much hope either, personally!\n\nI'd be ecstatic with a three-way draw and a middle power alliance has made all the sense in the world to me since day one, so that is my goal... Hopefully Italy will see the light and realize if he leaves France unchecked that France may very well end up with 14,000 points to his name!\r\n3 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: So, can you imagine Ska attacking Norway? What if Mos supported Norway to Stp while Norwegian slid into Norway? Baltic could cover Swe while Kiel covers Den, Ruh covers Kiel and Sil covers Mun... This could get you to seven centers and a build! Think about it and let me know since Mos hitting Sev would be useful as well, but the highest priority is keeping you as strong as possible, which will also result in you being able to slow down the E/F as much as possible...\r\n4 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: I am 100% aligned with a central powers alliance; France and England are, quite obviously, my biggest threats right now, and I must handle them. I'd love to take St. Pete; I can see that it would help both of us immensely, and if there's something I've learned this game, it's that you put a dying dog out of its misery. If Moscow will support Norway to St. Pete, I will move Norway to St. Pete and NWG to Norway per your suggestion. Similarly, Silesia will move to Munich to help cover my home centers. I've thought long and hard about this, and it is a great plan. I will gladly take your support into St. Pete.\n\nFrance will get, at most, one build this turn, and after Italy's moves I can see that we are in a delicate situation. In the interest of equal growth, would you consider letting Italy hold onto Trieste, Smyrna and Ankara so that he can equip his western front with enough firepower to push back France? I would consider it a long-term investment in our continued viability, and a strong strategy to contain E/F. I eagerly await your response.\r\n5 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: Great, glad you are onboard! Moscow will support you into Stp, that works for both of us as you suggest. France is a HUGE concern and I am in agreement on Italy keeping Trieste, Smy and Ank. Glad the three of us finally appear to be on the same page, I've been pushing this Central Powers alliance since day one, here's to our success!! :-)\r\n",

Any other initial thoughts?\r\n1 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: Mao support holds Spa is great. Also, Bel support hold Holl seems really necessary so you can try to attack Kiel. Germany have to defend both Kiel and Ber, so I hope Pic could move to Bur this turn.\nAbout Mars, I will move Gas with Spa support, so if Austria support me or cut Pie support it can work, but I am not that sure about Austria real intentions, so that&s why a support for Spa will come on good time.....\r\n2 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: Sounds good. MAO will support hold at Spain and I'll try to take Kiel while you try to take Mar. I'm unsure of Austria's intentions as well, but hopefully one of us gets a build this year even though I have a bad feeling neither of us will. :(\r\n3 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: The Russian is really pissing me off. Russia is nearly demanding I help him get a German center this year, this after stealing Norway from me. I'm going to shift units on him just as soon as we are a bit more stable, which should be soon with Italy losing a unit this year. You should be able to take Mar next year, I'd imagine, can't wait for both of us to break out and join Turkey (and maybe Austria) in wrapping this game up, it's been pretty slow and frustrating, but it will all be worth it in the end! :)\r\n4 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: I hope so, we have been in the defense for a long time.\nAbout Russia, I try to get something from him, but he just answered that he don&t have nothing to talk about with me. Not a good sign I think. Hope A/T crush him first and then start to fight....\r\n5 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I'm not a big fan of the Russian lately either, I have a very bad feeling about him as well...\r\n",

In your position as you were last turn you were basically secure; he couldn't defeat you without another fleet bordering Smyr, which I would have easily stopped. Now you're much more vulnerable.\n\nI'd love it if you could reconsider your decision and join our side. England, France and I are already working together as I'm sure you've deduced, and we're set to win the fight quite easily at the moment. Our alliance was formed to stop the Austria-germany alliance, and as such our current agreement is a three way draw. We would be very willing to open that to a four way on the same understanding. As for your possible SC gains, Bulgaria, Greece, Rumania and Sevastopol would be obvious locations for Turkish occupation. Let me know your thoughts.\r\n1 TURKEY -> ITALY: I was hoping to speak to you actually. Austria has betrayed me twice, and now it is my turn to betray them. I have given the illusion that we are in am alliance, but I only said that so.he would free up units from around me. Now I am much more set up to attack him if I so wish.\n\nMake no mistake, I am fully against him. Tell me what you need me to do and I would love to end in a draw with the three of you.\r\n2 ITALY -> TURKEY: Excellent. Well obviously at the moment I need you to prove your intentions so I'll leave that to you, but might I suggest slipping Aeg into Bul and Eastern to Aeg? It guarantees you a build and will split Austria's attention nicely.\r\n3 TURKEY -> ITALY: That was my original plan.\r\n",
