What do you think?\n3 RUSSIA -> ITALY: That's an interesting proposal, Italy. I like the idea of putting pressure on Austria. However, I'm not sure if moving my army from Ukraine to Rumania is the best move for me right now. What if I were to move my army from Galicia to Bohemia instead? That would also put pressure on Austria and potentially open up some opportunities for us to gain more centers. What do you think about that?\n4 ITALY -> RUSSIA: That's a good point, Russia. Moving your army from Galicia to Bohemia could definitely put pressure on Austria. If you do that, I could also move my army from Venice to Trieste, which would further threaten Austria's position. We could potentially gain a lot of ground if we coordinate our moves correctly.\n5 RUSSIA -> ITALY: I think that's a great plan, Italy. Let's work together to take down Austria. I'll move my army from Galicia to Bohemia, and you can move your army from Venice to Trieste. With a little luck, we can gain some valuable centers and improve our positions on the board.\n6 ITALY -> RUSSIA: I'm glad we could come to an agreement, Russia. Let's make sure to follow through on our plans and work together to take down Austria. I'll make sure to move my army from Venice to Trieste, and I expect you to move your army from Galicia to Bohemia. Let's make this turn count!\n7 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Let's confirm our moves one more time to make sure we're on the same page. I'll move my army from Galicia to Bohemia, and you'll move your army from Venice to Trieste. Let's make this turn count and take down Austria!\n8 ITALY -> RUSSIA: I'm glad we could come to an agreement, Russia.

I'll make sure to move my army from Venice to Trieste, and I expect you to move your army from Galicia to Bohemia. Let's make this turn count! And also, let's discuss about the next turn, how we can further cooperate to gain more centers.\n9 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Yes, I agree to continue our cooperation in the next turn. Let's discuss how we can further divide the spoils of Austria and potentially take on other powers. I was thinking that we could work together to take down Germany, they seem weak and divided. What are your thoughts on that?\n10 ITALY -> RUSSIA: That's a great idea, Russia. Taking down Germany would be a great way to further our interests. I was thinking that we could coordinate our moves to take out their army in Kiel. If you move your army from Moscow to Prussia, I could move my army from Tyrolia to Munich, and we could put pressure on Germany from both sides. What do you think?\n11 RUSSIA -> ITALY: I agree with your plan to take down Germany. Moving my army from Moscow to Prussia and your army from Tyrolia to Munich would put significant pressure on them. Let's make it happen and further our interests.\n12 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Excellent, I'm glad we're on the same page. Let's make sure to follow through on our plans and take down Germany. I'll move my army from Tyrolia to Munich, and I expect you to move your army from Moscow to Prussia. Let's make this turn count! And let's continue to discuss our plans for future turns, maybe we can work together to take down England as well.\n13 RUSSIA -> ITALY: I'm glad we're on the same page, Italy. Let's continue to work together to take down Germany and potentially England. What's your plan for the next turn?\n14 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Let's continue to discuss our plans for the next turn. I was thinking that we could work together to take out England's army in North Sea. If you move your army from Prussia to Baltic Sea, I could move my army from Munich to Burgundy, and we could put pressure on England from both sides. What do you think?\n15 RUSSIA -> ITALY: I think that's a great plan, Italy. Let's work together to take out England's army in North Sea. If we can successfully do that, we can further our interests and gain more centers. What do you think about moving your army from Munich to Holland to support our efforts?\n16 ITALY -> RUSSIA: I think that's a great idea, Russia. Moving my army from Munich to Holland would definitely support our efforts to take out England's army in North Sea.

As Austria, I'm looking to expand my territory and influence in the region.

Would you be willing to support my fleet in the North Sea moving to Norway, in exchange for my army in Denmark supporting your army in Bulgaria?\n3 TURKEY -> ENGLAND: I like your proposal, but I would like to modify it slightly. Instead of supporting your fleet in the North Sea, could you support my army in Greece moving to Serbia, and in return, I'll support your army in Bulgaria?\n4 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: That sounds like a good compromise, Turkey.
