Would you be willing to move your army from ALB to GRE instead, and we can work together to take down Austria from different angles?\n2 ITALY -> RUSSIA: That's a good point, Russia. Moving your army from BUD to WAR would definitely put pressure on Austria. If I move my army from ALB to GRE, we can still work together to take down Austria, but we'd be coming at it from different angles. I like that idea.

What are your thoughts on this?\n1 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: Hello Turkey, I appreciate your willingness to discuss potential moves. However, I'm not sure I'm comfortable with your army supporting Sweden, as it could potentially threaten my position in Northwest. How about we discuss a different arrangement?
