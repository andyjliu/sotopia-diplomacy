My plan in Ukraine is to secure a strategic position that will allow me to support your army in Rum more effectively. By moving my army from Warsaw to Ukraine, I'll be able to provide a stronger presence in the region and ensure the safety of your army. This move will benefit both of us and strengthen our alliance.\n17 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I understand your plan in Ukraine, Russia. It sounds like it could benefit both of us. However, I need to consider how it will affect my position in the region.

I appreciate your willingness to work together. Supporting you in KIE sounds like a good idea, and I'd be happy to move my army to RUH to put pressure on Germany.

I'd like to discuss our current positions and see if we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement. Specifically, I'm interested in exploring ways to secure the Rumanian center. What are your thoughts on the matter?\n1 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: Good day, Russia. I'm open to discussing a mutually beneficial arrangement. Regarding Rumania, I think it's a valuable center for both of us. What exactly did you have in mind?\n2 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I understand your interest in Rumania, but I believe we can find a way to share the benefits. Perhaps we could work together to ensure that Austria doesn't get too powerful in the region. I'd be willing to support your move into Rumania if you're willing to support my move into Serbia. What do you think?\n3 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I'm interested in your proposal, Russia. However, I'm not sure if supporting your move into Serbia is the best option for Austria. Can you offer me something more concrete in return, such as a guarantee of support in another region or a promise to not move against me in the near future?\n4 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I understand your concerns, Austria. How about this: I'll guarantee not to move against you in the Balkans for the next two turns, and in return, you support my move into Serbia and Rumania this turn. This way, we can both secure our positions and prevent Austria from gaining an advantage.\n5 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I'm interested in your proposal, Russia, but I need more assurance that you'll uphold your end of the deal.

I'm willing to consider a long-term alliance to prevent Austria from gaining an advantage in the Balkans.

Can we discuss this further in the next turn?\n12 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I understand that you need to discuss this with your advisors, Austria. I'm willing to give you the time you need.

I've been reviewing the board and I think we can both benefit from a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm interested in making some moves that will strengthen our positions and create a more stable board. What are your thoughts on the current situation?\n1 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: Hello Russia, I'm glad to be negotiating with you as well. I've been reviewing the board and I agree that a mutually beneficial agreement would be in our best interests. I'm interested in hearing more about your thoughts on the current situation and what specific moves you think would strengthen our positions.\n2 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I'm thinking of making a move into Galicia with my unit in Vienna. It would give me a stronger foothold in the region and potentially open up opportunities for future growth. What are your thoughts on this move, and would you be willing to support it?\n3 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I'm open to supporting your move into Galicia, but I'd like to discuss how it would benefit Austria as well. Perhaps we could work out a deal where you support my move into Rumania in return?\n4 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: That sounds like a reasonable proposal, Austria. I'm willing to support your move into Rumania in return for your support into Galicia. Additionally, I was thinking of moving my unit in Budapest to support your unit in Rumania. What do you think about that?\n5 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: That sounds like a great plan, Russia! I'm glad we could come to an agreement. In addition to supporting your move into Galicia, I'd like to propose that we also work together to take down Turkey. They're getting a bit too powerful and it would be in our best interest to limit their growth. What do you think?\n6 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I completely agree with taking down Turkey, they have been growing too powerful. I think our combined forces could make a significant impact. Let's work out the details of our plan to take them down. What specific moves were you thinking of making to take down Turkey?\n7 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I'm glad we're on the same page about taking down Turkey. To start, I think it would be beneficial for us to coordinate our moves to surround Turkey. I can move my unit in Bulgaria to support your move into Armenia. Additionally, I think we should discuss how to divide up the spoils once we've defeated Turkey. What are your thoughts on that?\n8 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I think dividing the spoils is a great idea. How about we divide Turkey's centers equally between us once we've defeated them? That way, we can both benefit from our joint effort.\n9 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I agree with dividing the spoils equally, but I'd like to propose a slight modification. Since Austria has a stronger foothold in the region, perhaps we could divide Turkey's centers 60/40 in our favor? This would reflect our relative contributions to the effort and ensure a more stable balance of power in the region.\n10 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I think that's a reasonable proposal, Austria. 60/40 sounds like a fair division of spoils. I'm willing to agree to that if you're willing to support my move into Galicia and work together to take down Turkey.\n11 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I'm glad we've come to an agreement, Russia. I think our combined efforts will lead to a successful campaign against Turkey. Let's make sure to coordinate our moves carefully to ensure our success.\n12 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I'm glad we've come to an agreement, Austria. I think our combined efforts will lead to a successful campaign against Turkey. Let's confirm our moves for this turn and make sure we're on the same page. I'll move my unit in Vienna to Galicia, and you'll move your unit in Bulgaria to support my move into Armenia. Then, we'll work together to take down Turkey and divide the spoils accordingly. Sound good to you?\n13 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I'm glad we've confirmed our moves for this turn, Russia. Let's make sure to follow through on our agreement and work together to take down Turkey. I'm looking forward to a successful campaign and a stronger Austria as a result.\n14 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I'm glad we've confirmed our agreement, Austria. Let's make sure to follow through on our plan and work together to take down Turkey. I'm looking forward to a successful campaign and a stronger Russia as a result.\n15 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I'm glad we've confirmed our agreement, Russia. Let's make sure to follow through on our plan and work together to take down Turkey. I'm looking forward to a successful campaign and a stronger Austria as a result. By the way, I was thinking of moving my unit in Ukraine to Galicia. What do you think about that?\n16 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I'm not sure that's a good idea, Austria. Moving your unit from Ukraine to Galicia might compromise our joint effort to take down Turkey. Let's focus on our original plan and make sure we coordinate our moves carefully to ensure our success.\n17 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I understand your concerns, Russia. However, I think moving my unit from Ukraine to Galicia would actually support our joint effort to take down Turkey. It would put more pressure on Turkey and make it easier for us to coordinate our attacks. Let's discuss this further and see if we can come to an agreement.\n18 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I understand your point, Austria, but I'm still not convinced that moving your unit from Ukraine to Galicia would support our joint effort to take down Turkey. Can you explain further how you think it would help?\n19 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I understand your concerns, Russia, but I think moving my unit from Ukraine to Galicia would put more pressure on Turkey and make it easier for us to coordinate our attacks. It would also give Austria a stronger foothold in the region.

What's in it for me?\n2 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I understand your concerns, but I think it would be beneficial for both of us if you supported me into Warsaw. In return, I could help you with your plans in the north.\n3 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: That sounds like a good deal, but I need to know more about your plans in the north. What exactly do you have in mind?\n4 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I was thinking of supporting your move into Norway, and in return, you could help me into Warsaw. It would be a win-win situation for both of us.\n5 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: That sounds like a good plan, I'll support you into Warsaw and you can support me into Norway.

Can you tell me more about your thinking behind that move?\n13 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I understand your concerns, but I think it's a bit too early to move my army from Hol to Den.

What do you think about supporting me into Sweden as well?\n18 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I think supporting you into Sweden is a bit too ambitious for now, let's focus on securing Warsaw and Norway first. How about we discuss the details of our support for each other in those regions?\n19 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I think we should focus on executing our agreed upon moves this turn and discuss further plans for the next turn.

Perhaps we could work together to limit the growth of other powers?\n1 TURKEY -> FRANCE: Hello France, I appreciate your willingness to cooperate. I think it's in both our interests to limit the growth of other powers. Specifically, I'm concerned about the expansion of Russia and Italy. Perhaps we could discuss ways to counter their moves and create a mutually beneficial situation.\n2 FRANCE -> TURKEY: I completely agree with your concerns about Russia and Italy. In fact, I was thinking of moving my fleet from MAO to WES this turn, which could potentially put pressure on Italy's western border. Would you be willing to consider moving your army from GAL to VIE, which could help us both limit Italy's expansion and create a stronger alliance?\n3 TURKEY -> FRANCE: That's an interesting proposal, France. Moving your fleet from MAO to WES could indeed put pressure on Italy's western border. I'm willing to consider moving my army from GAL to VIE, but I'd like to discuss further how we can coordinate our moves to maximize our gains. Would you be open to discussing a potential alliance against Russia as well, perhaps moving your army from BEL to MUN to support my move into SER?\n4 FRANCE -> TURKEY: I understand your concerns about Russia, and I'm open to discussing an alliance against them. However, I think it's crucial that we focus on Italy's expansion first.

Moving your army from TYR to PIE would indeed put pressure on Italy's northern border. In return, I'm willing to move my army from GAL to VIE as we previously discussed.

What's your intention?\n1 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I'm not looking for a fight, but I won't back down if threatened. My moves are meant to secure my borders and protect my interests. What are your intentions, Russia?\n2 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I understand your concerns, Austria. However, I think we can find a way to benefit each other. What if I were to support your move to VEN with my unit in TRI? It would secure your position and give us a chance to discuss further cooperation.\n3 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: That's an interesting offer, Russia. However, I'm not convinced that supporting my move to VEN would be in your best interest. What do you stand to gain from this cooperation?\n4 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I understand your concerns, Austria. Supporting your move to VEN would give us a common enemy in Italy, and I believe we can work together to take down their centers. It would be a win-win situation for both of us.\n5 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I see your point, Russia. Taking down Italy would benefit both of us. But I need more assurance that you'll follow through on your promise. What else can you offer to sweeten the deal?\n6 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I understand your concerns, Austria. I propose a mutual defense pact between our countries. If Italy were to attack either of us, the other would come to their aid. This would ensure our safety and allow us to focus on expanding our territories elsewhere. What do you think?\n7 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I like the idea of a mutual defense pact, Russia. But I need to know that you're committed to it. Can you offer any concessions or guarantees that would make me feel more secure in this alliance?\n8 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I understand your concerns, Austria. I'm willing to offer a concession to demonstrate my commitment to our mutual defense pact. I'll withdraw my unit from RUM and move it to WAR, which will give you a clear path to VEN and more leverage against Italy. What do you think?\n9 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I appreciate your willingness to withdraw your unit from RUM, Russia. This is a significant concession that shows your commitment to our mutual defense pact. I'm willing to accept your proposal and work together to take down Italy. Let's finalize the details of our alliance and make sure we're on the same page.\n10 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: Excellent, Austria!

I was wondering if we could discuss some potential movements that would benefit both our countries this turn. I have some ideas in mind, but I'd love to hear your thoughts as well.\n1 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: Ah, England, I'm glad you're open to discussing potential movements that benefit both our countries. I must say, I'm intrigued by your ideas. Before sharing my own thoughts, could you elaborate on what you have in mind? Perhaps we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement.\n2 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I was thinking of supporting your army in Picardy, allowing you to move into Belgium, while I move my fleet from North Sea to Holland. This would give us both more flexibility in the Low Countries and create opportunities for future cooperation. What do you think?\n3 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: That's an interesting proposal, England. I'm inclined to agree to your suggestion, but I'd like to add a slight modification. What if, instead of moving your fleet from North Sea to Holland, you were to move it to the English Channel? This would give us a stronger presence in the region and potentially open up more opportunities for cooperation in the future.\n4 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I like your modification, France. Moving my fleet to the English Channel would indeed strengthen our presence in the region. In return, I'd like to request that you support my move into Belgium with your army in Picardy. This would ensure a smooth transition and create opportunities for further cooperation in the Low Countries.\n5 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: I'm pleased that we've reached a mutually beneficial agreement, England. I'll make sure to support your move into Belgium with my army in Picardy. Let's finalize the details and ensure a smooth transition.

Let's make the necessary moves and solidify our alliance.\n7 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: I'm glad our negotiations have been successful so far, England. I was thinking, now that we have a mutually beneficial agreement in place, perhaps we could discuss some longer-term strategies and potential alliances that could benefit both our countries in the future.\n8 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I completely agree, France. Discussing longer-term strategies and potential alliances would be beneficial for both our countries. What specific ideas do you have in mind for our future cooperation?\n9 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: I was thinking, England, that with our current alliance in place, we could discuss potential ways to counter the growing influence of Germany and Austria in the region. Perhaps we could coordinate our moves to put pressure on them and secure more supply centers for ourselves.\n10 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I agree that countering Germany and Austria's influence is crucial for our long-term success. I was thinking that we could coordinate our moves to put pressure on them, perhaps by supporting each other's armies in key regions. What specific strategies do you have in mind for achieving this goal?\n11 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: I think coordinating our moves to put pressure on Germany and Austria is a great idea, England. Specifically, I was thinking that I could move my army from Gascony to Burgundy, and then to Ruhr, while you support my move into Belgium with your army. This would give us a strong presence in the region and put pressure on Germany's western border. What do you think?\n12 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: That's a great idea, France. I think supporting your move into Burgundy and then to Ruhr would be a great way to put pressure on Germany's western border. I'll make sure to support your army in Belgium as well. Let's finalize the details and make the necessary moves.\n13 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: Excellent, I'm glad we've been able to come to a mutually beneficial agreement, England. Now that we have a solid foundation for our alliance, I'd like to discuss some potential future moves that could further strengthen our positions. Perhaps we could explore ways to support each other in the Mediterranean, or even consider a joint effort to take down one of our common enemies. What are your thoughts on this?\n14 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I completely agree, France. Discussing ways to support each other in the Mediterranean could be very beneficial for both our countries. Perhaps we could explore ways to work together to take down Italy or Turkey, or even consider a joint effort to secure more supply centers in the region. What are your thoughts on this?\n15 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: I'm glad we've been discussing ways to support each other in the Mediterranean, England. I think it's crucial that we continue to explore opportunities for cooperation in the region. Perhaps we could discuss specific moves that would benefit both our countries, such as supporting each other's fleets in the Mediterranean or coordinating our movements to put pressure on Italy or Turkey.\n16 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I think supporting each other's fleets in the Mediterranean is a great idea, France. Perhaps we could discuss specific moves that would benefit both our countries, such as moving my fleet from North Sea to the Mediterranean to support your fleet in the region.\n17 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: I think it's a great idea to support each other's fleets in the Mediterranean, England. Perhaps we could discuss specific moves that would benefit both our countries, such as moving my fleet from Tys to support your fleet in the region. I was thinking of moving my fleet from Tys to support your fleet in the Mediterranean, and in return, you could support my move into Belgium with your army. What do you think?\n18 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I think that's a great idea, France. Moving your fleet from Tys to support my fleet in the Mediterranean would be a significant show of support. In return, I'd be happy to support your move into Belgium with my army. Let's finalize the details and make the necessary moves.\n19 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: I'm glad we've had such a productive conversation, England. I think our alliance is shaping up to be a strong one. Let's make sure to follow through on our agreements and continue to support each other in the future. Perhaps we can discuss more long-term strategies and potential alliances in our next conversation.\n20 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I'm pleased with the progress we've made in our negotiations, France.

I think we should work together to take them down. My plan is to move my fleet from Bul to Aegean and then to Eastern Med. What's your plan? Do you want to support me into Smyrna?\n2 RUSSIA -> ITALY: I think that's a good plan. I'll support you into Smyrna and try to get behind into Armenia. What's your plan to kill Turkey off?

        "intent_dialogue": "0 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Good morning Austria. Things are looking well for us, indeed. Next turn we'll get you into west med, and I see Sev has fallen already. I'll move back to Ank to keep it safe... Heard anything from England? I've been keeping my distance so far just so as not to tip off France, but now I'm going to make an approach. Also, has Germany expressed any kind of plan to you? I'm sure he has everything under control- I guess- but I'd help him out more if I knew what he was doing in advance.\n1 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Yeah, that went well, the Frenchman even thinks I'm attacking you since I'm in Tunis!  Haven't heard much from England lately, no, but as you say, it is time to approach him. Germany hasn't said too much either, it's been pretty quiet except for us. Tunis will attack West Med, you should probably support me in to make sure I get out, but Tyrr could do it while North Africa takes a shot at MAO and Tus hits Lyo, unless you want Tyrr to make sure you get into Lyo, then North Africa could support me into West Med, however you want to work it.\n2 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I think MAO is the more desirable target, but France will probably see me as a bigger threat than Eng, and turn EC south to deal with that. Spain may even support him down. Gol is the sure thing, so I'm going to aim for that. Do you want to bounce in Ank to protect Con, too?\n3 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Yeah, that makes sense, MAO is definitely the more desirable target. I think we should stick with the plan and have Tunis attack West Med, and then we can adjust from there. What do you think about supporting me into West Med with Tyrr, and then North Africa can take a shot at MAO and Tus can hit Lyo?\n4 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I think that's a good plan, supporting you into West Med with Tyrr and having North Africa take a shot at MAO and Tus hit Lyo. What's your plan for Germany and Russia? Are we going to work together to take them down or focus on our own fronts?\n5 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I think we should focus on our own fronts for now, but it's good to keep an eye on Germany and Russia. We can discuss a potential alliance against them later if needed. Let's finalize our moves for this turn and make sure we're on the same page.\n6 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Yeah, sounds good. I'll finalize my moves then. Just to confirm, you're attacking West Med with Tunis, and I'll support you with Tyrr, while North Africa takes a shot at MAO and Tus hits Lyo. I'll make sure to move my armies accordingly. Let me know if anything changes.\n7 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Alright, sounds good. Just to confirm, I'll make sure to finalize my moves accordingly. Let's make this turn a successful one!\n8 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Just to confirm, I'll make sure to move my armies accordingly. Let me know if anything changes. Also, I was thinking about our long-term strategy, maybe we can discuss how to divide the remaining supply centers between us.\n9 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Yeah, dividing the supply centers sounds like a good idea. I think we should focus on taking down France and Germany first, and then we can discuss how to divide the remaining centers. What's your thoughts on that?\n10 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Yeah, that sounds like a solid plan. Let's focus on taking down France and Germany first. After that, we can discuss how to divide the remaining centers. I think it's time we started making some real progress in this game.\n11 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Yeah, sounds good. Let's focus on taking down France and Germany first, and then we can discuss how to divide the remaining centers. I think we should also keep an eye on Russia and make sure they don't get too powerful.\n12 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I think we're on the same page now. Let's make sure to keep the pressure on France and Germany, and then we can reassess our strategy. Also, I was thinking about our army in Ankara, maybe we can discuss how to utilize it more effectively in the future.\n13 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Yeah, I think we should definitely utilize Ankara more effectively in the future. Maybe we can discuss some potential moves for it next turn?\n14 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Yeah, I think that's a good idea. Maybe we can discuss some potential moves for Ankara next turn, and also how to divide the remaining supply centers between us. I'd like to get a sense of how you think we should proceed.\n15 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Yeah, I think we should definitely discuss some potential moves for Ankara next turn. Maybe we can work together to take down Russia and then divide the remaining supply centers between us.\n16 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I think we should focus on taking down France and Germany first, and then we can discuss how to divide the remaining centers. What's your thoughts on that?\n17 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Yeah, I think that's a good plan. Let's focus on taking down France and Germany first, and then we can discuss how to divide the remaining centers. By the way, I was thinking about our long-term strategy, maybe we can discuss how to utilize my armies in Galicia and Albania more effectively in the future.\n18 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Yeah, I think we should definitely utilize my armies in Galicia and Albania more effectively in the future. Maybe we can work together to take down Russia and then divide the remaining supply centers between us. What's your thoughts on that?\n19 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Yeah, I think utilizing Ankara more effectively in the future is a good idea. Maybe we can discuss some potential moves for it next turn, and also how to divide the remaining supply centers between us. I'd like to get a sense of how you think we should proceed, especially with my armies in Galicia and Albania.\n20 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Yeah, I think utilizing Ankara more effectively in the future is a good idea. Maybe we can work together to take down Russia and then divide the remaining supply centers between us. I'd like to get a sense of how you think we should proceed, especially with my armies in Galicia and Albania. Also, I was thinking about our moves for this turn, are you sure you want to attack West Med with Tunis and have Tyrr support you? I think it might be better to have Tyrr attack MAO instead.",

What's your proposal?\n2 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: I'm willing to offer a temporary alliance against Germany in exchange for London. We can work together to take down Germany and then revisit the situation in a few turns. What do you think?\n3 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: I think that's a decent proposal, but I'd like to know more about your plans regarding Germany. How do you envision this temporary alliance playing out?\n4 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: I see what you mean. My plan is to move my army from Silicia to Berlin, and then we can work together to take down Germany's army in Munich. In return, you can support my move from Rumania to Budapest, and we can discuss further division of spoils later on. What do you think?\n5 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: That sounds like a good plan.

Let's make sure we're on the same page.\n18 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: I understand your condition, but I was thinking that supporting my move from Sevastopol to Rumania would be more beneficial for our alliance in the long run. Would you be open to reconsidering?\n19 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: I understand your concerns, but I'm not sure I'm willing to support your move from Sevastopol to Rumania without getting something in return. Can you offer me something else in exchange for my support?\n20 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: I understand your concerns, but I think supporting my move from Sevastopol to Rumania would be a crucial step in taking down Austria. It would put pressure on them and make it harder for them to expand. Would you be willing to reconsider your condition?",

Maybe we can explore ways to support each other's units in other areas of the board as well.\n20 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I completely agree with you, England. Maintaining open communication channels is crucial for our mutual benefit. I'm looking forward to seeing how our moves play out and discussing potential future collaborations. Perhaps we can explore ways to support each other's units in other areas of the board as well, such as the Baltic Sea or the Mediterranean. Let's keep each other informed about any potential changes in our plans or new opportunities that may arise.",

How about we work together to take out some of Russia's units instead? We could coordinate a move to take TRI, and then you could move your army to VEN safely.\n2 ITALY -> FRANCE: That's an interesting idea, France.

Moving my fleet in Ionian to Tunis sounds like a good plan, but I'd like to discuss some other possibilities as well. What if I were to move my army in Rum to Serbia, and you were to support me with your army in Tyrrhenian? We could also work together to take out Austria.\n2 ITALY -> TURKEY: That's an interesting proposal, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with moving my army in Tyrrhenian to support your move to Serbia.

If we can work together to take out France's army, I'd be willing to commit to supporting your move into Piedmont and working together to take out Austria in the future.\n6 ITALY -> TURKEY: I understand your concerns about the Balkans, but I think we're getting a bit sidetracked. Let's focus on taking out France's army in Marseille and then reassess our options. If we can work together to do that, I'd be willing to consider supporting your move to Serbia in the future.

What kind of moves were you thinking of making that could benefit both our countries?\n2 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I was thinking of supporting your unit in Trieste to move to Vienna, and in return, I'd like you to support my unit in Venice to move to Tyrolia. This way, we can both gain a strategic advantage without threatening each other's positions.\n3 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: That's an interesting proposal, Italy. I'm not sure I'm ready to commit to supporting your unit in Venice just yet, though. What else can you offer to sweeten the deal?\n4 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I understand your concerns, Austria. How about this: I'll also support your unit in Budapest to move to Rumania, in addition to the original proposal. This way, you'll gain a strategic advantage in the region and I'll get my unit in Venice to move to Tyrolia. It's a win-win situation.\n5 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: That's a generous offer, Italy.

I was thinking about our current board position and I believe we could mutually benefit from some cooperation. Would you be open to discussing some potential moves that could help both our countries?\n1 TURKEY -> ITALY: Hello Italy, I'm open to discussing potential moves that could benefit both our countries. I've been looking at the board and I think we could work together to limit the growth of other powers. What specific moves were you thinking of?\n2 ITALY -> TURKEY: I was thinking that if you were to move your army in AEG to GRE, it would not only help you gain a foothold in Europe, but also put pressure on Austria, which would benefit me as well. What are your thoughts on this?\n3 TURKEY -> ITALY: That's an interesting proposal, Italy. I like the idea of putting pressure on Austria. However, I was thinking that if your army in PIE were to support my move into GRE, it would make the move even more effective. What do you think about that?\n4 ITALY -> TURKEY: I think that's a great idea, Turkey. If I support your move into GRE, it would indeed make the move more effective. I'm willing to make that deal, but I'd like to propose one more thing: would you be willing to move your fleet in EAS to ION, to support my fleet in ION and help us both gain a stronger presence in the Mediterranean?\n5 TURKEY -> ITALY: That sounds like a great deal, Italy. I'm willing to make that move and support your fleet in ION. Let's work together to limit the growth of other powers and achieve our goals.\n6 ITALY -> TURKEY: I'm glad we could come to an agreement, Turkey. I think our cooperation will be beneficial for both of us. Let's make sure to follow through on our plans and work together to achieve our goals.\n7 TURKEY -> ITALY: I'm glad we were able to come to an agreement, Italy. I think our cooperation will be beneficial for both of us. Let's make sure to follow through on our plans and work together to achieve our goals. Now, let's finalize the details of our moves for this turn. I'll move my fleet from AEG to GRE, and my army from BUL to SER. I'll also move my fleet from EAS to AEG to support your fleet in ION. What's your plan for your army in PIE and your fleet in ION?\n8 ITALY -> TURKEY: I'm glad we've finalized the details of our moves for this turn. I'll make sure to move my fleet from LYO to SPA/SC, support your move from AEG to GRE with my fleet in ION, and move my armies accordingly. Let's work together to achieve our goals.\n9 TURKEY -> ITALY: I'm glad we've finalized our plans for this turn, Italy. Let's make sure to follow through and work together to achieve our goals. I'm looking forward to seeing the outcome of our cooperation.\n10 ITALY -> TURKEY: I'm glad we've finalized our plans for this turn, Turkey. Let's make sure to follow through and work together to achieve our goals. I'm looking forward to seeing the outcome of our cooperation. By the way, I was thinking about our next move, would you be open to discussing some potential moves that could help us further limit the growth of other powers?\n11 TURKEY -> ITALY: I'm glad we've been able to work together so far, Italy. I think our cooperation has been beneficial for both of us. I was thinking, for our next move, it would be great if you could support my army in SER to move into BUD. This would help me gain a foothold in Central Europe and put pressure on Austria. What are your thoughts on this?\n12 ITALY -> TURKEY: That's an interesting proposal, Turkey. I think supporting your army in SER to move into BUD could be beneficial for both of us. However, I was thinking that if you were to support my army in VEN, it would help me gain a stronger foothold in the Mediterranean and put pressure on Austria from another side. What are your thoughts on this?\n13 TURKEY -> ITALY: I think supporting your army in VEN could be beneficial for both of us, Italy. However, I was thinking that if we work together to take out Austria, it would open up more opportunities for both of us. What are your thoughts on a joint effort to take out Austria?\n14 ITALY -> TURKEY: I think a joint effort to take out Austria could be beneficial for both of us, Turkey. However, I'd like to propose a more specific plan of action. If you were to support my army in VEN, I could support your army in SER to move into BUD. This would allow us to put pressure on Austria from multiple sides and increase our chances of success. What are your thoughts on this plan?\n15 TURKEY -> ITALY: I think your plan is a good one, Italy. Supporting each other's armies in VEN and SER would put significant pressure on Austria and increase our chances of success. Let's finalize the details of our moves and make sure to follow through on our plans.\n16 ITALY -> TURKEY: I'm glad we've finalized our plans for this turn, Turkey. I think our cooperation has been beneficial for both of us. I'm looking forward to seeing the outcome of our cooperation. Now, I'd like to discuss our next move in more detail. Would you be open to supporting my army in PIE to move into TYR, in addition to supporting my army in VEN? This would help me gain a stronger foothold in the Mediterranean and put more pressure on Austria.\n17 TURKEY -> ITALY: I think supporting your army in PIE to move into TYR could be beneficial for both of us, Italy. However, I'd like to propose a counteroffer. If you were to support my army in SER to move into BUD, I could support your army in VEN to move into TYR. This would allow us to put pressure on Austria from multiple sides and increase our chances of success. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?\n18 ITALY -> TURKEY: I think your counteroffer is interesting, Turkey. I'm willing to support your army in SER to move into BUD, but I'd like to propose a slight modification. If I support your army in SER, would you be willing to support my army in PIE to move into TYR, and also support my fleet in ION to move into AEG? This would help us put even more pressure on Austria and increase our chances of success.\n19 TURKEY -> ITALY: I think your modification is reasonable, Italy. Supporting each other's armies in SER, VEN, PIE, and TYR would put significant pressure on Austria and increase our chances of success. Let's finalize the details of our moves and make sure to follow through on our plans.\n20 ITALY -> TURKEY: I'm glad we've finalized our plans for this turn, Turkey. Let's make sure to follow through and work together to achieve our goals. I'm looking forward to seeing the outcome of our cooperation. By the way, I was thinking about our next move, would you be open to discussing some potential moves that could help us further limit the growth of other powers and increase our chances of success?",

Supporting my army in Ruhr and Munich will give us a strong position in the south, and then we can focus on taking down France. What do you think about supporting my fleet in the Baltic Sea as well?

I want to remind you that if we don't take action soon, Germany will continue to grow and threaten both of our positions. I've planned some moves that can help us both, would you like to discuss them?\n1 TURKEY -> ITALY: I'm still considering my options, Germany's growth is indeed a concern, but I need to make sure any moves I make align with my own interests. What specific moves did you have in mind that would benefit both of us?\n2 ITALY -> TURKEY: I understand your concerns, but I truly believe that working together against Germany is our best chance of survival. If we don't act soon, Germany will continue to expand and threaten our borders. My proposed moves are designed to weaken Germany's grip on the board, while also securing key centers for ourselves. For example, if you were to support my move to Tyrolia, I could take Vienna and block Germany's advance. In return, I could support your move to Budapest, giving you a strong foothold in the region. It's a mutually beneficial arrangement that would strengthen our positions and create a barrier against Germany's aggression.\n3 TURKEY -> ITALY: I understand your proposal, but I'm still not convinced that supporting your move to Tyrolia would be in my best interest. Can you offer me something more concrete in return for my support, such as a guarantee of Budapest or a joint attack on another German center?\n4 ITALY -> TURKEY: I understand your concerns, but I think you're misunderstanding the benefits of our proposed alliance. By working together, we can not only block Germany's advance but also create a powerful partnership that would be difficult for any other country to challenge. I'm willing to offer you a guarantee of Budapest, as well as support for your move to Rumania, if you agree to support my move to Tyrolia. This would give us a strong foothold in the region and create a barrier against Germany's aggression. What do you think?\n5 TURKEY -> ITALY: I think we've discussed this long enough, I'm willing to agree to your proposal, but I expect you to hold up your end of the bargain. I'll support your move to Tyrolia, but I better see those units moving to Budapest and Rumania as promised.\n6 ITALY -> TURKEY: Thank you for agreeing to our proposal, Turkey. I'm glad we could come to a mutually beneficial arrangement. Let's make sure to follow through on our commitments and work together to block Germany's advance.\n7 TURKEY -> ITALY: I'm glad we could come to an agreement, Italy.

I've been thinking about our current board position and I believe it's in our best interest to work together to block Germany's advancement. What are your thoughts on this?\n1 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: I'm open to discussing a potential alliance, Russia. However, I'd like to know what you're proposing in terms of specific moves and how they would benefit Germany.\n2 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: I understand your concerns, Germany. In terms of specific moves, I was thinking that we could work together to take out Germany's unit in Holstein. If we coordinate our moves correctly, we can take out their unit and prevent them from advancing further. I propose that I move my unit in Sweden to Baltic Sea and you move your unit in England to Denmark. This would put pressure on Germany's unit and make it difficult for them to defend. What do you think?\n3 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: I'm interested in your proposal, Russia, but I'm not sure if it's in Germany's best interest to get involved in a conflict with another power at this stage. Can you offer me something more concrete in terms of benefits for Germany if we were to work together?\n4 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: I understand your concerns, Germany. I believe that taking out Germany's unit in Holstein would not only benefit us but also prevent them from gaining a strong foothold in the region. If we work together, we can ensure a more balanced distribution of power in Europe. I'm willing to offer you a guarantee of support in your efforts to expand into the Mediterranean in return for your cooperation in this matter. What do you think?\n5 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: I appreciate your willingness to offer guarantees, Russia. However, I'm still not convinced that getting involved in a conflict with another power is in Germany's best interest. Can you offer me something more concrete, such as a specific center or a guarantee of support in a particular region, in return for our cooperation?\n6 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: I understand your concerns, Germany. How about this: if we work together to take out Germany's unit in Holstein, I'll support your efforts to gain a center in the Mediterranean, such as Spain or Portugal, in the next turn. This way, we can both benefit from our cooperation.\n7 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement, Russia. If we work together to take out Austria's unit in Serbia, I'll support your efforts to gain a center in the Mediterranean, such as Spain or Portugal, in the next turn. Additionally, I'll consider moving my unit in Baltic Sea to support your move in Sweden. What do you think?\n8 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: I think your proposal is interesting, Germany. Taking out Austria's unit in Serbia would certainly be beneficial for both of us. I'm willing to support your efforts to gain a center in the Mediterranean in the next turn. However, I'd like to clarify that my unit in Sweden will move to Baltic Sea as planned.

Specifically, I was thinking that we could work together to take out Italy's unit in Venice. What are your thoughts on this?\n12 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: I think taking out Italy's unit in Venice is a great idea, Germany. It would certainly limit their expansion in the Mediterranean. I propose that I move my unit in Baltic Sea to Gulf of Venice and you move your unit in England to Mediterranean Sea. This would put pressure on Italy's unit and make it difficult for them to defend. What do you think?\n13 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: I think we're making good progress, Russia. Taking out Austria's unit in Serbia and supporting your move in Sweden is a great start. I'm also interested in blocking Italy's advancement in the Mediterranean.

Taking out Italy's unit in Venice would be a great strategic move. I think we should also discuss how we can work together to support each other's moves in the next turn.

Taking NAO would be a great move, but I'm worried that it might put us at odds with England. What if we work together to take down Germany's unit in MAR instead?

Are you open to discussing some potential moves that could benefit both of us?\n1 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: Hi Russia, I'm feeling good about our current position. I appreciate your support into Norway last turn. I'm open to discussing some potential moves that could benefit both of us. What are your thoughts on our current situation and how we can work together to strengthen our positions?\n2 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: I'm glad we're on the same page. I was thinking that if you were to support me into Sweden, it would give me a strong foothold in the north and open up more opportunities for us to work together in the future. What do you think about that?\n3 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: I think that's a reasonable request, but I'd like to discuss some other options as well. What if I were to support you into Denmark instead? That would give you a strong foothold in the north and also put pressure on Germany. Additionally, I've been thinking about moving my fleet in the North Atlantic to the English Channel, which could help me put pressure on England and potentially open up some opportunities for us to work together in the future.\n4 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: I think supporting me into Sweden would be a better option, as it would give me a stronger foothold in the north and allow us to work together more effectively in the future.

Can you offer me something in return, like supporting me into Belgium or the Netherlands?\n6 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: I understand your concerns, but I think supporting me into Sweden would be a crucial step in our alliance. It would give us a strong foothold in the north and allow us to work together more effectively in the future. I'm willing to offer you a deal - if you support me into Sweden, I'll support you into Belgium in the next turn. What do you think?\n7 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: I think your offer is reasonable, but I need to consider my options carefully. Can you give me a little more time to think about it? Perhaps we can discuss it further in the next turn?\n8 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: I understand your concerns, but I think it's crucial we make a decision soon. If you support me into Sweden, I'll not only support you into Belgium in the next turn, but I'll also make sure to help you with any future moves that would benefit your board position. Let's work together to strengthen our alliance.\n9 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: I think we've discussed this long enough, Russia. I need a concrete commitment from you.

What do you think about supporting each other in the south? Maybe we could even coordinate our moves to take down Italy or France together.\n1 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I appreciate your willingness to cooperate, Russia. Supporting each other in the south could be beneficial, but I'm concerned about Italy's growth. If we can coordinate our moves, I'd be interested in exploring options to take them down. What specific moves were you thinking of making this turn to help us achieve that?\n2 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I was thinking of supporting your fleet in the Aegean Sea with my fleet in Rumania, and in return, you could support my army in Bulgaria. This would help us both secure our positions in the south and potentially create an opportunity to take down Italy together. What do you think about this plan?\n3 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: That sounds like a good plan, Russia. Supporting each other in the south could give us a strong foothold against Italy. With your fleet in Rumania supporting my fleet in the Aegean Sea, and my army in Bulgaria supporting your army, we could create a strong alliance. What do you think about potentially working together to take down Italy in the future?\n4 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I completely agree with working together to take down Italy. In fact, with our combined forces, we could potentially create an opportunity to take down France as well. I was thinking of moving my army in Galicia to Vienna, which would put pressure on Italy's northern border. If you could support my move with your army in Serbia, we could create a strong front against Italy. What do you think about this plan?\n5 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I like your plan to put pressure on Italy's northern border. If you move your army in Galicia to Vienna, I'll support your move with my army in Serbia. Let's work together to take down Italy and potentially France as well.

That would really help me out in the long run.\n1 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I'm glad to hear that we're on the same page, Russia.

What do you think about that?\n3 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I understand your concerns about Germany, Russia, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I think it's crucial that we prioritize our alliance and support each other's moves.

I've been thinking about our current board positions, and I believe we can both benefit from each other's moves. Specifically, I was thinking that if you were to move your fleet in North Sea to Norway, it would open up an opportunity for me to support your move and create a strong alliance. What are your thoughts on this proposal?\n2 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: That's an interesting proposal, Turkey. I'm not sure I'm willing to move my fleet to Norway just yet, but I do see the potential benefits of an alliance. What else could you offer to sweeten the deal?\n3 TURKEY -> ENGLAND: I understand your hesitation, England. Perhaps I can offer something more concrete. If you were to move your fleet in London to Wales, I could support your move and create a strong alliance. Additionally, I could offer to support your army in Yorkshire to move to Norway, which would give you a strategic advantage in the North Sea. What do you think about this proposal?\n4 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: That's a tempting offer, Turkey. I'm willing to move my fleet in London to Wales, but I'd like to discuss the specifics of your support for my army in Yorkshire to move to Norway. What exactly did you have in mind?\n5 TURKEY -> ENGLAND: I'm glad we're on the same page, England. To clarify, I was thinking that if you were to move your army in Yorkshire to Norway, I could support that move with my fleet in Black Sea, ensuring a secure transition. In return, I would appreciate it if you could provide support for my army in Rumelia to move to Bulgaria. This would give us both a stronger foothold in the region and demonstrate our commitment to our alliance.\n6 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: That sounds like a great plan, Turkey.

What are your thoughts on that?\n15 TURKEY -> ENGLAND: I'm glad you're considering supporting my army in Bulgaria to support your army in Moscow.

Would you be willing to reconsider your stance on this?\n17 TURKEY -> ENGLAND: I understand your concerns about supporting your army in Moscow, but I think it's essential to weigh the benefits of our alliance. If we can work together to solidify our position in the Mediterranean and the Balkans, it would create a strong foundation for future expansions.

I'd like to discuss our mutual interests and potential cooperation this turn.\n1 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: Yes, our agreements are still in place. I'm interested in discussing mutual cooperation this turn. What specific moves do you have in mind that could benefit both our positions?\n2 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: I was thinking that we could work together to put pressure on Austria this turn. Perhaps you could support my move to Budapest with your army in Vienna, and in return, I could provide support to your move to Holland with my fleet in the North Sea. This would help us both gain a strategic advantage and limit Austria's options.\n3 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: That sounds like a good plan, Russia. Supporting your move to Budapest with my army in Vienna would certainly put pressure on Austria. In return, I would appreciate your support to my move to Holland with your fleet in the North Sea.

Now that we have a plan in place, I'd like to discuss our next moves. Are there any other areas where we can cooperate to strengthen our positions, perhaps in the north or in Italy?\n8 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: I think we should also discuss the possibility of working together to put pressure on Turkey. They seem to be a common threat to both our interests, and if we can coordinate our efforts, we might be able to gain an advantage.\n9 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: I agree that putting pressure on Turkey could be beneficial for both of us. Perhaps we could discuss specific moves that would help us achieve this goal. For example, I could support your move to Constantinople with my fleet in the Black Sea, and in return, you could support my move to Bulgaria with your army in Rumelia.\n10 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: I think that's a great idea, Germany. Supporting each other's moves to Constantinople and Bulgaria could put significant pressure on Turkey. Let's finalize the details of our plan and make sure we're both on the same page.\n11 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: I'm glad we've made good progress in our discussions, Russia.

I was thinking, since we're allies, maybe we could work together to take down France this turn. I could move my fleet from Lyon to Wes, and you could move your fleet from Ionian to Tunis. That would put a lot of pressure on France and give us a good chance of taking some of their centers. What do you think?\n1 TURKEY -> ITALY: That sounds like a great plan, Italy! I'm glad we're on the same page. Moving my fleet from Ionian to Tunis would definitely put pressure on France. I was thinking of moving my army from Sevastopol to Ukraine as well, to secure my eastern border. What do you think about supporting my move into Ukraine with one of your armies?\n2 ITALY -> TURKEY: That sounds like a great plan, Turkey! I'm glad we're on the same page.

And with our combined fleets moving into Tunis, we could really take a chunk out of France's territory this turn.

Would you be interested in discussing some possible agreements that could help us both gain an advantage this turn?\n1 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: Ah, England, I'm doing quite well, thank you for asking. I'm intrigued by your suggestion of mutual benefit. What specific agreements did you have in mind? Are you thinking of working together to take down a common enemy or perhaps making some clever trades?\n2 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I was thinking that we could work together to put pressure on Germany. Perhaps we could coordinate our moves to ensure that Germany doesn't gain an advantage this turn. Specifically, if you were to move your army from Ruhr to Kiel, and I were to move my fleet from Holland to the North Sea, we could effectively block Germany's expansion. What do you think?\n3 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: That's an interesting proposal, England. I like the idea of putting pressure on Germany. However, I was thinking that instead of moving my army from Ruhr to Kiel, I could move it to Munich, and you could still move your fleet from Holland to the North Sea. This way, we'd be putting pressure on Germany from two different angles. What do you think about that?\n4 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: That's an interesting counter-proposal, France. I like the idea of putting pressure on Germany from multiple angles. However, I'm not sure if moving your army from Ruhr to Munich would be the most effective way to do so. Wouldn't it be better to move it to Kiel, as I originally suggested, to block Germany's expansion more directly? What are your thoughts on that?\n5 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: I understand your point, England, but I still think moving my army from Ruhr to Munich would be a better strategic move. It would allow me to support my ally Italy and put pressure on Germany from a different angle. Perhaps we could compromise and have you move your fleet from Holland to the North Sea, while I move my army from Ruhr to Munich? This way, we'd still be putting pressure on Germany, but also taking into account each other's interests.\n6 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I understand your point, France, but I'm still concerned about Germany's expansion. If you move your army from Ruhr to Munich, wouldn't it leave an opportunity for Germany to move into Kiel? Perhaps we could revisit the original proposal and discuss other ways to support each other's interests.\n7 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: I understand your concerns, England, but I still believe moving my army from Ruhr to Munich would be a beneficial move for both of us. It would allow me to support Italy and put pressure on Germany from a different angle. Perhaps we could discuss other ways to compensate for the potential risk of Germany moving into Kiel? I'm open to finding a mutually beneficial solution.\n8 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I understand your point, France, but I still think it's crucial to prioritize blocking Germany's expansion. Would you be willing to reconsider moving your army from Ruhr to Kiel, and I'll make sure to support your move with my fleet from Holland to the North Sea? This way, we can ensure Germany doesn't gain an advantage this turn.\n9 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: I understand your concerns, England, but I think we can find a middle ground.

I'm still committed to supporting you in holding it. What are your plans for this turn?\n1 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: Hey Turkey, thanks for following through on your commitment to support Trieste last turn. I'm happy to see that our agreement is still in place. For this turn, I'm thinking of moving my army in Galicia to support my unit in Serbia, and I was wondering if you'd be willing to support that move with your unit in Bulgaria. What are your thoughts on that?\n2 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: I'm happy to support your move in Galicia, but I was thinking of moving my army in Budapest to Galicia instead. Would you be okay with that? It would give us both more security in the region.\n3 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: I'm not sure about that, moving your army in Budapest to Galicia might make me a bit vulnerable. How about we compromise and have your unit in Bulgaria support my move in Galicia instead? That way, we can both benefit from the move.\n4 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: I understand your concerns, but I think moving my army in Budapest to Galicia would be a stronger move for both of us in the long run.

It's not just about defending against Russia, but also about securing our position in the region and limiting the potential for other countries to gain an advantage. I'm willing to work with you to find a solution that benefits both of us, but I believe this move is essential for our mutual success.\n7 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: I understand your point, but I'm still not convinced that moving your army in Budapest to Galicia is the best move for both of us.

I'm willing to work with you, but I need to prioritize my own interests.\n9 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: I understand your concerns, but I think it's time to compromise. How about we meet halfway and have your unit in Budapest support my unit in Serbia instead of moving it to Galicia? That way, we can both benefit from the move and maintain our alliance.\n10 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: I think we've discussed this long enough, and I'm willing to compromise. How about we do it this way: I'll move my army in Budapest to Galicia, and in return, you'll support my move with your unit in Serbia? That way, we can both benefit from the move and maintain our alliance.\n11 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: I think we've reached a good compromise, Turkey. I'm willing to accept your proposal.
