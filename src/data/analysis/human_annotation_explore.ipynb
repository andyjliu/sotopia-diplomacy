I can't speak with much authority on every one of the other five players in here, but I know we have some natural born killers among us that would not think twice about killing either of us off, so please do consider that when choosing allies! I'm the sort that likes to work &with& other people, and for the long-term, for mutual gain, and with mutual growth.

I'm all for giving it a go, though we will need to baby step our way into it a bit, these things are not foolproof, so we do need to make a focused effort or it will all blow up in our faces.

I've been to Spain twice, and last summer met up with my brother and his family in Italy, but getting to France is still on my To Do List, hopefully one day! :-)\\n\\nI do like your idea, but there are two potential issues. One, it looks like you've just copied and pasted the message above, so I'm not sold on how sincere you actually are. Two, an I/R can be a little tricky in my experience, sense I can seldom get an Italian to actually follow through with a stab of Austria.\\n\\nAnyway, I'm open to all ideas at this point, but we will need to develop a good relationship and get in position to make this happen.

I suppose the main concept is that we agree to a NAP for quite some time and not much more than that, you get to focus on the northwest and E/G for the first several years of the game while I get to focus on the southeast and AIT for the first several years. It would be nice if I could grab Sweden in 1901, and if so, then use my fleet to help you as you see fit, perhaps even shifting from Sweden to Norway in 1902, and allowing you to have Sweden?\\n\\nAnyway, suppose that\\'s enough rambling for now, but I do hope you will give full consideration to at least a NAP so we can both focus elsewhere, but I\\'m open to other ideas as well, it\\'s just getting late and I need to get some sleep soon...\\n\\nThanks again for joining, this should be a great game, I very much look forward to it!! :-)\\r'},\n",

It can be a bit tricky, since Norway is typically pink after 1901, but if we can form some sort of peace in Scandinavia, agree to each have a little bit (I call Sweden!!), then we can both focus where the majority of our attention should be focused, you in the northwest and me in the southeast...

This is lunchbreak :)\\nSo, yes, I follow soccer, not regularly but I like the final stages of the major competitions. 1998 was indeed a very important event for the French people as it was the very first time we achieved the supreme goal. And because it was in France, everyone was excited and happy and there had been a lot of celebration in the streets. Spain now is the strongest country in soccer, and in several major sports.\\nI actually love Spain and Spanish people, but I have some reservation about their sport results as there are strong suspicions of an organized doping system covered by people in power..\\nBut it is a beautiful country. Where does your brother live?\\n\\nComing back to the game, no I did not copy paste the message, I just had not much time to write it, but wanted to send you my intentions early in the phase so that you would have some time to think about it.\\nYes, Russia has two fronts, which means that often you must make up your mind about which strategy to lead in the game: southern or northern. After you grow, you can consider fighting on both fronts, but in the initial phase you cannot therefore need to make a choice (apart if hostile powers attack you, there it simplifies the choice).\\n\\nSo as to sincerity, my general attitude to the game is to make a proposal that not only benefits me but also benefits the person I am talking to.\\nIf a proposal is too biaised in my interest, why would you be interested?\\nIf a proposal is too biaised in your interest, then most probably I am lying.\\nSo I am trying to find an ally, based on a reasonable long term plan that benefits both players. I usually am skeptical of direct neighbours, until proved otherwise.\\nBut with more distant players, the risk of the stab is lower, so I am more open in my comm.\\n\\nAs for the plan itself, my analysis is based on the fact that corner powers like England and Turkey are an annoyance to all other countries, so I do favour ridding of them early in the game.\\nYeah, you can go for a Juggernaut, but growth of Turkey is limited in the Med, and so there will always be a risk of a Turkish stab looming while you'll be busy on other fronts: eliminating Turkey soon is in Russia interest.\\nIt is also in my interest because it is a rival for naval domination of the Mediterranean.\\nThe nice thing about getting friendly first with Austria to eliminate Turkey is that then Austria finds itself in a bind between the two of us which makes it easy to eliminate, leading to our domination of the southeastern corner.\\nHowever, my stab of Austria depends essentially if I can get France in check: if the guy is not going for me, then I will have free hands to join forces against Austria.\\nBut usually France is busy in the north as it is rare that he allies with both ENG and GER.\\nThe only case it happens is of course the northern triple, but then you will be my ally anyhow as England will attack you up north.\\nSo I suggest that after you speak with other nations you let me know whether you are interested in my two step plans.\\n\\nI wish you a good game, and hope to speak with you soon!\\nGoing back to work now :)\\r\"},\n",

I think you make a great point about wanting to feel out how a potential ally prefers to play the game. This is a non anon game, but we haven\\'t played together before so I appreciate getting a chance to tell you about myself and sell my package of services, you might say. :)\\n\\nMy goal in the opening years is to find an ally that I am compatible. To me that means someone who prefers to \"all-in\" with a partnership. Someone that I can put my trust in and would trust me to not go for an easy one center and see the long term benefits of staying to together. It is funny that you mentioned interpreting every discussion as an argument, when I read this I related 100% and got excited to message you back. :) I too find that very annoying, if I\\'m going to throw down all my chips with someone I want to leave the cautious planned bounces and short-sighted arguments to other players. We would be much more successful trusting each other fully. I\\'ve had the type of ally you mentioned and it makes the game a pain in the ass when every plan/move is like pulling teeth to convince them you mean no harm. That\\'s not how I play. I do enjoy planning strategy and moves together, I feel the tactics are one of the stronger points of my game. One last point about myself, I play this game with honesty. I know this isn\\'t worth anything as written until you see it with actions, but I have taken the policy that the best diplomats rarely if ever lie. I have incorporated that into my game as a motto of sorts and it has already paid tremendous dividends.\\n\\nI think you will find that we are very compatible as allies. When you combine that with the fact we are sitting as the head of E and F....it\\'s a no-brainer. This is one of the most powerful alliances in the game and allows each of us to get a quick start.\\nThe western sphere is quite a tricky spot in the early years. I think we both realize that it typically ends up as a 2 on 1 and one of us gets squeezed out. But my hope is that you will realize that I am the type of player that you can trust, I have the tactical/strategical game in my tool belt, and well how else can I put this...location location location! :) If you are interested, I would love to talk more specifics with you about how this alliance, and these opening years could play out.\\n\\nI will be happy to leave the English Channel empty as you have requested. I will likely just open with the standard English opening to North and Norwegian seas and see where everyone is at from there, including Belgium.\\n\\nLets talk some more later on, I\\'m looking forward to hearing back from you!\\n\\nRegards,\\n[486017].

One to tremendous success for both Germany and I and one that fizzled out to an R/A. The point is, I've seen this alliance be extremely effective and agree we could have an excellent partnership. You know as well as I do that the western sphere is a tricky spot in the early years. I'm sure you have already received press from France since I found the game with a message in my inbox from him already as well. I want to reassure you that I am not one to choose allies based on the first message/offer I receive. I do have a playing style that is quite honest. I prefer to find an ally that I am compatible with and make that relationship a long term alliance. I prefer to go all-in with that ally and leave the cautious planned bounces and such to others b/c I think it slows us both down.

Especially since I can never seem to find a way to play that country in a way that feels... comfortable. You know what I mean?\\n\\nI think you will find my general approach to Diplomacy quite congenial to yours. That is, I tend to never play \\'position\\' or \\'natural alliances/enemies\\' just because the stats suggest that it would be wise to. Stats make sense on a fairly general level, but as you say, when you face a strong roster, when you have 6 creative guys on the board, you can\\'t find much comfort in stats.\\nI\\'ve had fun teaming up with Austria in the past when playing Turkey. Almost always it ended up in me stabbing Austria however. Almost always... That\\'s to say that I\\'ve also enjoyed long lasting alliances with Austria where we both saw the endgame. The key to such an alliance, however, lies in Austria\\'s hands. The reason is that there is very little Turkey can do in terms of varying the possibilities of movements in the first few years. Sure, I could straight out attack Russia, but the risk/reward ratio on such an opening is not that great. I find that the only way that can be worth one\\'s while is if Germany and England are willing to play their part and foil Russia\\'s plans in the north. Otherwise, such an opening tends to translate into Turkish demise.\\n\\nIt will be your moves, then, that will have the most potential at creating a space where you and I can work together.

In any event, it\\'s a real pleasure to find you \"around\" this board and I look forward to getting to know you better.\\n\\nI agree with you: Turkey must have a strong relation to Germany and Germany to Turkey if Russia and Austria are to be managed in a way that sees to our growth. It\\'s not necessarily a \"fighting\" alliance then, well, not in the first seasons anyway, but it is a key alliance nonetheless. You can therefore count on me to make every effort to see our relations grow into a full fledged alliance that ought to take us to interesting positions in the mid-game.\\n\\nIn saying that I don\\'t see GT as a fighting alliance, I don\\'t mean that they can\\'t be united in a blitzkrieg right from the start. The only thing about such a strategy is that Germany is then much more exposed than Turkey is, and so it calls for a fair deal of trust between the two allies. The other thing is that we would need Austria on our side. If Austria were to open in Gal and Ser while moving Tri to either Alb or... Venice, your move to Pru (and to Den) would put Russia in a very difficult spot. Meanwhile, I would have to open to Arm and count on Austria to play fair in the distribution of Balkan centres.\\nThat\\'s one way in which our countries could collaborate in a gutsy opening.

First, mid-game and end-game alliances tend to work better if you've taken the time to build the relation throughout the game (cause you never really know who will be part of those portions of the game). Second, sharing intel with distant countries is an important factor in getting the means to make it to these later years of the game.

Like I said in my opening press to you, I will go all-in with an ally I am meshing with, I want to open to the channel and north sea, which basically guarantees I make an enemy spring 1901 and shows you I'm serious about this and not blowing smoke up your ass. You would likely just do the standard german opening, denmark, kiel, ruhr.\\n\\nI would take norway and either get supported to belgium or bounce it or try for Brest, we'll just have to see how things are received. You would bounce Russia from Sweden. I would build fleet at liverpool to go for access to MAO. You would build a fleet at berlin and an army at munich.\\n\\nThe basics from that year 1 opening is I go 100% at France with assistance from 1 or 2 units of your units at Burgundy. You will focus east at Russia with assistance from my unit at norway. I would put you into sweden and then the extra fleet you built goes to GOB and subsequently one of us is supported to St.pete (just depends on who needs it), while you pressure warsaw with your land units. The general distribution of the spoils would be I would take the French centers less probably Paris and belgium for you, and you move east with your armies to take warsaw/moscow/sweden/ and maybe st.pete to me. I haven't run the numbers on that but in general, we may have to jostle the specifics here and there as we go and see what happens. The key is that we try and grow at the same pace, that we are a team - helping each other into the next dot. Also part of this reason I suspect this could be so effective is that we will keep the north sea empty, like I said I want to go all-in with you and if we can trust each other we will have so many extra units available at our disposal because we wont have to worry about covering edinburg/london/nth sea/denmark/holland etc. We can both go push our units to their maximum offensive effectiveness.\\n\\nLet me know what you think, this is how I have run it in the past but we can certainly switch things up as I've never dealt with Italy jumping in and figuring a balance there when the west will fall much sooner.

Anyway, I'm all for discussing options!\\n\\nFor me, as Russia, I'm not too big of a fan of not bouncing unless we have some sort of agreed upon plan in place. I'm not overly excited about taking Sev to Rum in spring 1901, that sort of ties my hands in regards to a land attack, so I do prefer an army in Rum by the end of 1901. Sev heading to BS provides me with some security, which is nice, but sometimes not having security is the best way to get a Jugg going, since it does need some disguising to be successful, or at least that's what I've found... Anyway, since you are a Rookie Jugger, perhaps it is worth gaining a little experience with such an adventure? I'm open to your thoughts on us not bouncing, as far as what we'd both be doing in 1901, but to be fair, I am leaning towards sending Sev to BS, so do come up with something good! :-)\\n\\nNot opening to Arm sounds great to me, but if you have a plan that includes that, feel free to run it by me, even if I ultimately shoot it down! ;-)\\n\\nAs far as opening south or north, it is my nature to open south, but at some point on webDIP I noticed how well Jacob does with Russia and he seems to open north a lot, so I have not ruled that out. It'll come down to your thoughts on how we open and a general feel for the board, which I often am not the greatest at in the pregame since everyone loves to blow sunshine up my ass... Anyway, I'll be back later tonight (and I'll log on in the morning before orders get processed, though perhaps only 30 minutes beforehand, we'll see), let me know your thoughts!!\\r\"},\n",

Minus is that he is far from the stalemate line.\\nBut the reason you should worry is that RUS TUR alliance NEVER works the whole game: yeah Juggernaut is powerful, but at some stage Turkey WILL stab, simply because his option of expanding west are limited compared to trying to seize Sev-mos and break the stalemate line, which he needs for a solo.\\nIn any case, yes, I am still favourable to the two-step plan: first Turkey down then Austria.

He means, I think, to concentrate his troops in the money area and force himself into a lucrative alliance with E or F. Fairly classic.\\n\\nAustria and Italy are both a bit tentative.
