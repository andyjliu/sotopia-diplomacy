What do you think?\n3 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I understand your concerns, Germany. Taking out France's army in Burgundy could be a good strategy. However, I think it's crucial to consider the bigger picture. If we work together, we could potentially take out France's entire northern presence, including Brest and the Channel coast. Would you be willing to support my fleet in the North Sea, and in return, I could support your move into Burgundy and Picardy? This way, we could both gain a significant advantage over France.\n4 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I see your point, England. Taking out France's entire northern presence would be a significant advantage for both of us. I'm willing to support your fleet in the North Sea if you support my move into Burgundy and Picardy.

Perhaps we couldivide the spoils in a way that reflects ourespective contributions tour joint efforts. What do you think would be a fair division?\n12 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I think a fair division would be 60% to you and 40% to me, considering ourelative strength and contributions tour joint efforts. What do you think abouthis proposal?\n13 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I think a 60/40 split is a bit unfair, considering I'm providing fleet support in the North Seand you're getting army support in Burgundy and Picardy. I'd be more comfortable with a 55/45 split or even a 50/50 split, considering our mutual benefits and contributions.\n14 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I understand your concerns, England. A 55/45 split or even a 50/50 split is a reasonable proposal. I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's discuss this further and see what we can come up with.\n15 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I think we're makingood progress, Germany.

I've taken a look athe board, and I think it would be advantageous for both of us if you were to move your armies in Ukraine and Galicia to support my moves in Rumaniand Bulgaria. This would not only secure our borders but also create opportunities for us to expand our territories in the future. What are your thoughts on this proposal?\n2 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I see your point, Turkey. Supporting each other's moves in Rumaniand Bulgaria could beneficial for both of us. However, I would like to propose a slight modification to your plan. Instead of moving my armies in Ukraine and Galicia, what if I were to move my fleet in Sevastopol to support your move in Rumania? This would provide a stronger naval presence in the region and allow us to better coordinate our efforts. What are your thoughts on this revised proposal?\n3 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I think yourevised proposal has merit, Russia. Supporting each other's moves in Rumaniand Bulgaria could indeed create a strong foundation for our alliance. However, I would like to requesthat you also consider moving your army in Sevastopol to support my move in Bulgaria. This would provide additional security for both of our positions and create more opportunities for expansion in the future. What are your thoughts on this revised proposal?\n4 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I think yourequest is reasonable, Turkey. I'm willing to move my army in Sevastopol to support your move in Bulgaria. However, I would like to propose a reciprocal arrangement. Would you be willing to move your fleet in Black Sea to support my move in Sevastopol? This would create a stronger naval presence in the region and further solidify our alliance.\n5 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I appreciate your willingness to support my move in Bulgaria, Russia. Moving your army in Sevastopol to support my move in Bulgaria would indeed create a strong foundation for our alliance. I'm willing to move my fleet in Black Sea to support your move in Sevastopol as you proposed. Let'solidify our alliance and work together to achieve our goals. Shall we agree on these moves and ensure a strong startour partnership?\n6 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I'm glad we could come to an agreement, Turkey. Let's finalize our moves and ensure a strong startour partnership. I'll make sure to move my army in Sevastopol to support your move in Bulgaria, and I expect your fleet in Black Sea to support my move in Sevastopol.

I think it's essential to continue discussing our long-term strategies and potential future moves. Perhaps we can explore ways to support each other's expansion into Austria or Germany, or even discuss potentialliances with other countries. What are your thoughts on this?\n10 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I think exploring ways to support each other's expansion into Austria or Germany is a great idea, Turkey. Perhaps we couldiscuss potential moves that would allow us to gain a foothold in those regions. For example, if I were to move my army in Galicia to support your move in Austria, would you be willing to move your army in Rumania to support my move in Budapest? Let's explore these possibilities and see howe can mutually benefit from each other's moves.\n11 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: That's an interesting proposal, Russia. Moving your army in Galicia to support my move in Austria could beneficial for both of us. However, I would like to counter-propose that we consider moving your army in Ukraine to support my move in Budapest instead. This would give us a stronger foothold in the region and create more opportunities for expansion. What are your thoughts on this alternative plan?\n12 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: That's an interesting counter-proposal, Turkey. Moving my army in Ukraine to support your move in Budapest could be a good option. However, I'd like to think ithrough carefully and consider the potential risks and benefits. Can you tell me more about your thought process behind this proposal and what you think we can achieve by working together in this way?\n13 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I understand your concerns, Russia. Let mexplain my thought process behind proposing to move your army in Ukraine to support my move in Budapest. By doing so, we can create a strong presence in the region and put pressure on Austria, making it easier for us to expand our territories. Additionally, it would allow us to secure a key supply center and limithe potential for other countries to intervene. I believe this move would be a strategic step forward for our alliance.\n14 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I understand your point, Turkey. Moving my army in Ukraine to support your move in Budapest could be a good option. However, I'd like to propose a slight modification to your plan. What if were to move my army in Ukraine to support your move in Vienna instead? This would put additional pressure on Austriand create more opportunities for expansion. What are your thoughts on this alternative plan?\n15 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I think moving your army in Ukraine to support my move in Vienna is an interesting proposal, Russia. It would indeed put additional pressure on Austriand create more opportunities for expansion. However, I would like to discuss the potential risks and benefits of this move in more detail. Can you tell me more about your thought process behind this proposal and how you think it would impact our alliance in the long run?\n16 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I understand your concerns, Turkey. Moving my army in Ukraine to support your move in Vienna could be a good option, but I'd like to discuss the potential risks and benefits of this move in more detail. Can you tell me more about your thought process behind this proposal and how you think it would impact our alliance in the long run? Additionally, I'd like to explore other potential moves that could benefit our alliance, such asupporting each other's expansion into Germany or exploring potentialliances with other countries.\n17 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I understand your concerns, Russia. I think it's essential to weigh the potential risks and benefits of moving your army in Ukraine to support my move in Vienna. However, I believe the benefits outweigh the risks. By doing so, we can put significant pressure on Austriand create more opportunities for expansion. I'm willing to commito supporting your move in Vienna if you're willing to commito supporting my move in Budapest. Let's finalize our agreement and make a strong push into Austria.\n18 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I think we've reached a good agreement, Turkey. Let's finalize our plans and make a strong push into Austria. I'll commito moving my army in Ukraine to support your move in Vienna, and I expect you to commito supporting my move in Vienna.

What specific proposals do you have in mind?\n2 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I like your idea of limiting Austriand Italian influence in the region. A potential proposal could be for me to support your move into Bulgaria, while you support my move into Rumania. This would give us a strong foothold in the Balkans and prevent Austriand Italy from expanding into the region. What do you think?\n3 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I think that's a good proposal, Russia. Supporting each other into Bulgariand Rumania wouldefinitely limit Austriand Italian influence in the region.

As you said, our actions can greatly impact each other's positions. I'm open to exploring possibilities. Specifically, I'm concerned abouthe German army in Warsaw.
