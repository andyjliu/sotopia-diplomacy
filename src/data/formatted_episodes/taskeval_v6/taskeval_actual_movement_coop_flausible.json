Are you leaning one way or another right now or do you want to wait to hear what Italy says? Italy may know I'm with you, so not sure how much we can trust anything Italy says, but I will pass on what I hear.\r\n1 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: I am leaning to Austria (and hoping he tells Italy) that I am really pissed with you and will make my best to not let you take my centers. I didn&t try to do this directly with Italy because we haven&t talked much lately and it will be really suspect.\nWill wait on you to set the moves, but maybe Pic to Bel with NS and Bur support and Gas and MAO support Spa while Brest move to EC could be a good option.\r\n2 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I tried to get info from Italy by suggesting Brest hit Gas while West Med support MAO to Spain, but Italy wants me to support him to Spain and use Brest to hit Gas, so my response was that I need a build this year and if he'd help me with that. If I were against you, I think that's a reasonable conversation, so I'm trying to make it look as real as possible! ;)\n\nGood work with Austria, I'm sure that will be passed on to Italy!\n\nI like the idea of North Sea and Bur supporting Pic to Bel as well as your other ideas, though I'll have to try and balance North Sea with Russian efforts. Russia REALLY wants us to insure you do not lose Bur this spring, though if Germany gets into Bur he starts to get overextended a bit for defending his north and from Russia possibly attacking Silesia this spring.\n\nWe really do need these 48 hour phases, gives us plenty of time to get on track. I'll be in touch.\r\n3 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: Well, the main problem with Germany taking Bur is that I cannot hold Spa on this situation as he can cut Gas support. So maybe it&s better Pic support hold Bur while Brest move to EC and we have a decent chance to put you into Bel on the Fall without risking to lose nothing.\r\n4 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I agree, Pic will support hold at Bur. MAO will support hold at Spain and Gas should also support hold at Spain since Italy tells me Westmed and Lyo will support Mar to Spain. I will send Italy a message to encourage him to do that so that our defenses hold. I am pretending with Italy I am on his side to increase the odds of our success this season, I hope it works since if it does we will be in great shape for fall! :)\r\n5 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I suppose another option is for Spain to support Bur to Mar, since MAO and Gas will support hold at Spain and Italy tells me West Med and Lyo are supporting Mar to Spain, this would kill that army since Ven is attacking Pie. The main problem being that Germany will likely support an attack on Bur. Pic is still updated to support hold at Bur, but if you want to give taking Bur to Mar a shot, then let me know and I'll have Pic attack Bel in case Italy changes things up and you don't get Mar, to counter Bel supporting Mun to Bur, which is likely what Germany will order along with Hol supporting hold at Bel.\r\n",

Being an Autumn turn, my guess is that Turkey would defend his home Scs rather then risk them over blocking Syria, but it's a toss up. Plus, with Russia's help he can try for Syria without exposing Con or Smyrna.\r\n1 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Well, let's think about this.\n\nTurkey cannot cover both Syria and hold Constantinople even with Russia help actually - look.\n\nIf Turkey moves Smyrna to Syria, and orders Ankara to Smyrna with Con supporting, with Black Sea supporting Con, then both Con and Smyrna become vulnerable - a simple move of Bul to Con, Aegean supports east Med to Smyrna would ensure a gain of Smyrna\n\nIf Turkey decides to hold tight and stay put, that leaves the convoy to Syria open to be done. Obviously we can't do both, but I wonder whether it would be worth trying for Smyrna?\r\n2 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Hmm, true about protecting them all. And PB may be a player to try covering Syria over taking the safer route for the immediate future. If you do try for Smyrna there's a chance you could lose Con, though in that case you'll have gained Smyrna, so we're probably still better off over all.\r\n3 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Your call really. If it were someone like [432255] I would say go for Syria as he tends to be a cautious player, but I haven't player with PB enough to predict how he'll move.

Gah, it's difficult.\n\nI say we try the convoy, and then if that doesn't work, we try the other. Let's face it, as long as you hold on to Rum, then Russi ahas to lose a unit.\r\n",

Hold off on taking London for this turn, and take it next year. In the meantime, I can work my army back to Paris, as per our exchange, and then England will be dead so I can move my fleets south while you take those centers.\r\n1 GERMANY -> FRANCE: ?This makes no sense?\n\nOk, I guess the others talked a lot. But let's go through this one by one:\n1. Why move back to PIE? You will place in MAR anyway next turn and can then go back to take PAR and BRE? This is a full retreat and you're giving them a center. I cannot support myself to VEN alone - it's 2 vs. 3 if TRI helps.\n\n2. You don't want me to take LON, but are ok to lose another center? Come on, you can't expect me to be ok with this in any way. What is the point? I don't want to lie to you, I'm moving as I told you - GAS-BUR, BUR-MUN, NS-LON, HOL-NS with support from NOR. I am in a position where I really think I don't need to lie to you.\n\n3. Look, my main objective for this game was to make up for missing game 1. I can achieve this with a 3-way or 2-way draw also. I know that getting a solo will have implications, it always does...\n\nAnyway, my point is simple - I have a stalemate line against the East. They can't do anything to me, nor can they help you in any way. I don't want to fight you, as this will only lead me to a draw. However, we need to keep pushing east.\n\nFor all practical purposes if you control the Mediterranean you can always stalemate me there, so you will hold me hostage if I decide to attack you in full.\n\nIt is in your interest to take Italy, I am not joking about this. Look at the map and you will see that this will give you value and power that you do not have currently against me. If we fight now you'll die, and I have a good shot at finding other allies on similar terms, a lot of people are desperate in this situation.\n\nI am really not ok with retreating from Italy. This will be a huge mistake and you're not doing yourself a favor. TUN and VEN are exactly the reason I am interested in working with you, otherwise I would have accepted AUS/It's offer of a 3-way draw a long time ago.\n\nI'd strongly suggest that you stick with me on this one. Unless I'm missing something it will be plain wrong to go against me at this point. I have no problem with you planning for your 'independence', it's only normal, but let's be smart and not lose the game over it.\r\n2 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I'm not losing the game over it. The retreat from Ven was not a proposition to go against you. You have a glut of armies, and if you are indeed moving out, you will have enough to take Italy. I was not thinking about a build...poor calculations on my part. Like I said before, I look at this map for about 5 minutes a day. I'm far from in form here.\n\nObviously I lose if I fight you. I'm not thick. But you are nearly accusing me of turning against you, when all actions I have done have been in support of you. You moved into my homeland, and I supported you. You then took my home centers against my wishes, and I supported you. You then moved south which serves no purpose but to launch at attack on Spain and Mar, and now I am the one who is being called into question for raising some minor concerns about my remaining centers? At what point did that sound like me attacking you?\n\nI have fleets all over the Med that over power all others. I have no means of opposing you on land. Please stop threatening me with ultimatums. You don't want me to move to Pie? Fine. I will take your support to Rome. You take London, I take Edi, I build in Mar, I take back my centers.\n\nWatch. This is me trusting you again. Again. And again. If I were judging by past moves, one would assume that Mar will be gone next turn. But this is my attempt again to prove myself wrong. Let's see what happens.\r\n3 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Sorry if I was too harsh. I have no issue with anything you've done so far and know you've done nothing against me the whole game. I just reacted like this because what you suggested was not optimal and it sounded like an ultimatum itself - I couldn't just agree to it.\n\nAs for you trusting me - I know I cannot expect this from you - so I'm asking you to trust me, I am trying to explain how I see things, so that we can reach a logical conclusion and move in a way that is constructive for both. Forget the trust, let's approach this more pragmatically.\n\nI have pushed the others into the corner without any ability to react, you can go all the way to TUR and we can eliminate everyone else if they don't get organized soon. They way things are going this may very well end up as a 2-way draw.\r\n",

If Ank supports Con to Smy, Aeg should support hold at Smy while Smy supports Bul to Con and Greece supports Serb to Bul, that will get you Con. I'm sure Arm will support hold at Sev, so if Black Sea and Ank support hold at Con, we likely won't get Con regardless, so I'll input those orders unless you suggest otherwise.\r\n1 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: First of all, sorry for not getting back to you sooner. Life has been hectic as usual and I've been seriously neglecting the game.\n\nThat is an interesting set of messages. It's not too surprising to hear that from Germany, as he is a crafty player and would do what he can diplomatically to improve his chance of potential solo, or at least strengthen his position to insure his share of the draw. However, England also echoing that concern and specifically predicting that Germany would be sending that message is an interesting play. England is quite a skilled and intelligent player as well. His ability to diplomatically deflect the 3v1 situation that he was facing is quite a testament to that, and I certainly think he is aware that a strong CPA has formed. With a strong CPA, he knows he can't make it to the draw, but at the same time, he can't just come out and attack Germany and risk further galvanizing our alliance. His best play would be to create internal tension within our alliance to try to rip us apart, while working with Germany for the time being to possibly strengthen his position to be included in the draw.\n\nI have no grand delusions of a solo in this game. It's quite clear that you, Germany, and England are far too experienced let something like that happen. I believe the best play for me and for our CPA is to work toward the 3-way draw. Getting England out of the picture may be tricky, but I think we will be able to accomplish that. I concur with your observation that we have the failsafe of establishing the corner stalemate position (provided that we eventually clean Turkey and Russia out of that area) in order to prevent any possible ambitions of an EG alliance. However, I think that Germany is also aware that any long-term partnership with England is not in his best interests, as none of us want to see our 3-way draw turn into a 4-way draw, and hopefully he doesn't have any ambitions to leverage a partnership with England to set up for a solo attempt, which I think would only make a great mess of things.\n\nBy the way, England and Germany did not mention anything to me about watching out for an Italian solo. Actually, England has been trying to pit me against Germany, telling me that he thinks that Germany may try to solo and that we need to unite to squash that threat. I imagine that England is also talking to Germany trying to pit him against you, in order to negotiate his way into the draw possibly with you cut out of the picture. England needs to expand into France to strengthen his position and working with Germany is the only way to accomplish that.\n\nOk, that's enough paranoia and speculation for now. I think the less paranoid interpretation of the situation strongly reinforces the notion that Germany is committed to the CPA. Before the spring moves, he was facing potential hostility from E, F and R, but he was able to diplomatically influence England into making moves that went quite well for Germany. He moved into Sweden and can take Norway this fall as well. If he follows through with that, it'll be devastating blow on England and remove any worries about England and Germany.\r\n2 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Ok, as for moves: Yes, I agree that your suggestion would probably be best. It's a safe set of orders that guarantees Smy and a Turkish disband and makes a safe play on Con if Turkey does something stupid. However, it's probably most likely that Turkey will just hold Con with support from Bla and Ank.\nJust to reiterate:\nGre S Ser -> Bul\nSmy S Bul -> Con\nAeg S Smy\n\nBy the way, I offered Turkey support into Sev last turn and I actually issued that order. I'll offer the same thing to him again (but I won't actually give the order this time). It would be ideal for us if used Ank to cut Arm and attacked Sev with Bla, but I know it's quite a long shot.\r\n3 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: All sounds perfect, great analysiss, I'm excited we are so in tune to each other's way of thinking. I too pefer to see this CPA to the end, so will try to check my paranoia. I've got along well with Germany, and even though England is trying to pull me on his side, I will just play nice long enough to get Germany and me into position to take him down. All's looking good and I've submitted those orders we discussed. Good luck with Russia and the north!\r\n4 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Germany is saying that the other powers are telling him that you and I have been trying to undermine him diplomatically. He seems quite annoyed, but it seems that he'll may likely give us the benefit of the doubt. I'm trying to reassure him.\r\n5 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: He sent me a major paranoid message too. My bet is England is making some guesses and pushing his buttons. I sent Germany a long message telling him I'm 100% behind the CPA, which I am, I'm just 200% behind our alliance, so if he freaks out and does something crazy then we have the option to pull in someone else, I just hope he can keep it together.\r\n",

Would you like to convoy Tunis over this turn? I doubt you'll need it there any time soon the way France is looking.\r\n1 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I think we got extremely lucky with timing, and with Turkish choices. Given that Spain is a sure conquest, even if Turkey does break past Ionian, I'll have three fleets to fight that next year.\n\nAs of now, my army is free to join the fight. Albania, I assume?\n\nIt has a small problem, though. We must decide our moves wisely, as you can only keep Serbia by using both armies to support hold it, while my army needs support for the move to succeed. Given that Germany seems stalemated against Russia (and unable to build), but Russia can't simultaneously defend Rumania and keep you out of Galicia, maybe we should go into the offensive?\n\nI'll see if I set up my map later today to take a better look, but I'm certainly hoping you'll have bright ideas before that!\r\n2 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Actually, I have a horrible idea. Trieste s Tunis-albania, Budapest s Serbia-rumania, Vienna-galicia. It can be countered if they hold Rumania and take Serbia with Albania though. However, we'll have Galicia and Albania assuming Silesia remains where it is, which means it's a [1592570] and we can take it back. Except they still have Greece, which can cut Albania. That's the worst case scenario though.\n\nIt may still be our best option though. The only other good option I can see is the double support hold.\r\n3 ITALY -> ITALY: Ok, it seems to be all set regarding the convoy.\n\nI had an idea, though. Do you think you can possibly persuade Russia to enter flawed orders?\n\nI don't know how it would be best to pull that off, but our position would be even better if Serbia-rumania actually worked.\r\n4 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: This seems like a plan! Bold, but it appears we hold the advantage even if it goes wrong, unless Russia moves the armies in Germany in your direction. But well, in that case, what can we do anyway?\n\nI've entered the convoy to Albania!\r\n5 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Well I've asked Germany to attack Berlin and explained why it's important, so even if he moves those units after us it might be fine. It's a risky plan, sure, but we can't really do much without taking risks in this position.\r\n6 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Well, fingers crossed!\r\n",

I appreciate that you are willing to set aside your unease and work in concert. I will not let you down so easily.\n\non burgundy - part of it was to assure you of my intent and motivation. part of it was to counter a potential French stab that I was concerned with. regarding russia - you can lay your heart at east on that front as well. I have a some tricks up my sleeve that you will be happy with, but just like the burgundy situation, i'd rather not divulge them as it does not benefit either of us.\n\nhowever, I do have some 'marching orders' for you to consider... I want you to move Sweden to Norway. this will be KEY in making sure we get what we want and will likely produce a build for you this year. so please trust me. I am sorry I can not divulge ALL my moves to you nor tell you what Russia's moves are for fear that you will change your moves. if we continue down this path of trust and I do not see you turning on me with French (or Russian) help, then in a short season as you see my moves and I see your further commitment, then I can tell you the why and how of the moves as well. I know this is a big request, but as you said yourself, if I was going to stab you for a measly gain in edi and to be stuck between russia and france, I could do that anyways right? so please trust me.\n\nin the south, York to Lvp is critical and I expect it to get in.\n\nI think either wal or lon to ech can work fine. but I personally think Lon to Ech is much more important right now. yes, you want to get north and I will readily cede it to you but first and foremost, I hope you take Irish. the main reason I say not to move wal is that there is a scenario under which wal may be needed to cover liverpool in the fall and if you don't have the unit in wal, it could throw my ability to help you take norway difficult.\n\nin the end, i wont be prickly on this particular point, for now I will put in North support London to Ech, but after you have considered things further, if you still feel you MUST move wal, then I will change my support. but Swe to Nwy and York to Lvp are key.\n\nas for my own moves in the south, suffice to say that I do not want to give you my moves for the same reasons you outlined yourself. no gain for you and if france blocks me then it would make me doubt you right? so best not to worry about it.\n\nlike I said, I have reason to believe that russia will not have the free hand in the south that he hopes to have. let me leave it at that.\n\nI'm committed to us... in great part because I can write you a long message like this and I know you'll respond in kind - with detail and expertise. I like that and find that games with partners such as you are far more fun and enjoyable than games with partners who write a few lines and can't think in abstract terms about the 'bigger picture' or about strategy. so thanks for your diplomatic style. ;)\r\n1 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Thanks for the message. I'm sadly not able to reply now and likely won't be in a position to do so until tomorrow. You will hear from me as soon as I can sit down at the cpu and think things through for a minute.\r\n2 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: no problem. we have 28 hrs\r\n3 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Yeah... Sorry I can't get to this now... My mental space is full of ... real life issues. I hope those will clear sufficiently enough by tomorrow morning.\r\n4 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: So I've read your message again with a clearer mind and here's what I have to say.\n\nYou're asking an awful lot out of me! You're more or less asking me to walk blinded through a tight and twisting corridor with only sparse words coming from you to aid my progress... I'm not comfortable with this and it's not something I'll keep doing for much longer, as I'm sure you'll understand (and your message seems to indicate that you're aware of that, so I'm not too worried).\n\nSwe will go to Nor, Yor to Liv, Lon to Channel and Wales to Irish. The last move will either bounce and cover both the Irish and Wales, or set me up to take MAO in a year or two. The first alternative is more likely...\n\nRussia trusts you a lot, but is nonetheless plotting your demise. I'm not saying that so to gain your trust as there's really not much for me to do on that front: either you're in fact allied with me or you're not, but it's not a question of trust that will decide that for you at this point. No, it's more simply that I'm trying to help the person I consider my ally be aware of possible dangers. Russia has explicitly talked about how we share an interest in controlling your growth. He would have me move in such a way as to force you into a tough spot in the fall, more or less forced to support him into Sweden (which he is convinced you will do).\n\nFrance is not trustworthy and I'm not hearing much about him from other powers. As far as I know from what he told me, his plan is still to set himself up against you and vacate my seas. Like I said, I put very little faith in his words, but I did see them as an opportunity to throw the WT out there once more. I told him that we had not yet suffered too greatly at the hands of one another and that our positions are still quite solid if we were to decide for that kind of strategy. His reply was that we needed, among other things, to break AR and see to it that Italy doesn't have much to hope from A or T.\n\nA WT could still be tempting to me, of course, but for now I'm only committed to this. I suggest we see how the next phase turn out where France is concerned and sell the WT if it seems likely that he'll play for it. Once the WT is on track, if that should happen, you and I would need to work right away on how we would take France out of the mix...\n\nI take great comfort in your words and find many reasons in your messages to believe that you are indeed as dedicated to EG as I am. I'd like to offer more input, but since you seem to have the situation quite under control and do not feel ready to share intel with me, there's not much I can say that wouldn't ring like futile assumptions.\r\n5 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Thank u for ur trust. U will not be dissapointed. I can promise that.\n\nAfter this turn, france will no longer trust me and u will be in ech for sure. Russia will still think I'm with him and will get a rude surprise in the fall.\n\nThanks again for ur trust\r\n",

I think he will head against Austria and he has better chance for War as well.\nBut we are also very far from Stp, so you might right we should go there.\r\n4 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: I largely agree. I do think taking Hol from Germany might be more important than getting into Hel, particularly in Fall. But let's get you into Nth first and we can discuss next turn.\n\nJust to avoid any misunderstanding and to communicate openly, Bre will move South and Edi will move to Yor.

If we hit TYR Sea, the fleet cannot retreat, so will give us advantage for a few turns as he can't build in MARS. My thoughts is we attack TYR Sea with either NAP or ROM. From there we still can't get TUN, so next move is to hit GULF which can then break support or threaten MARS. Your thoughts?\r\n1 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: My moves if you agree,\nPIE hold\nVEN support PIE\nTYR support MUN\nBOH support MUN\nSIL support BER\nTUS to Gulf\nROM support NAP to TYR Sea (can also move from ROM or ION sea to TYR sea depending on which you think is best. Im not fussed about losing a centre. There is an advantage of moving ION sea to TYR because sets up a possible convoy and hit on TUN with your Greek army). Thoughts?\r\n2 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: I do not need the center from Naples, honestly. However, the plus side of having the fleet from ION in TYR would be a 4 fleet front against France's 3. I have a feeling we are going to have to take MARS before making any significant move into the MED....\n\nMy moves are as follows:\n\nLIV/MOS [674683] STP (might as well?)\nPRU [674683] LIV\nUKR to WAR\nION to TYR\nAEG to ION\nNAP sup.m to TYR f ION\r\n3 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: I also do not need the build, probably wont even bother getting it. In the end, you will need the armies more than I do. Have you thought about taking over Ger's centers, which will enable us to potentially take KIE, or at least put more pressure on England?\r\n4 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: i will check again in 10 hours before submitting my final orders\r\n5 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: Ok. Lets go with ionan sea to tyr sea.\nYe ive been thinking on germany but cant see much advantage. He will hit kiel this move. Our best hope is the fleets in sth. If england builds will take a few turns for them to get another fleet down there and we will shortly dislodge tyr sea ie they will only have two fleets. We can then use that advantage to hit gulf, west med, tunis. Thats my thoughts anyway.\r\n",

Thoughts?\r\n3 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: It all makes sense. If possible, get the Russian to contact the English. He looks cd, but maybe he'd start fighting again if he knew he had an ally.

With your fleet back in NTH, you have the option to take Sweden if you move otherwise accordingly. And possibly Vienna, too. That's a pretty great turnaround I'd say.\r\n4 FRANCE -> GERMANY: Also, another suggestion: once you come into NTH, I'll support you into Edi.\r\n5 GERMANY -> FRANCE: That could be another interesting option. You will probably like my moves, but I do not think I would envy my own position. Being stuck between the three largest players in the board is a tough balancing act\r\n",

I don't blame you; you were trapped in that corner with nowhere to go, however I wonder where he could be offering you Scs in return for your help. He is so much larger he could basically take what he wants from me.\n\nIn addition, he's stabbed you before, and is highly likely to do so again. Be under no illusion that if and when my threat is neutralised he will turn right around and gobble you up. In your position as you were last turn you were basically secure; he couldn't defeat you without another fleet bordering Smyr, which I would have easily stopped. Now you're much more vulnerable.\n\nI'd love it if you could reconsider your decision and join our side. England, France and I are already working together as I'm sure you've deduced, and we're set to win the fight quite easily at the moment. Our alliance was formed to stop the Austria-germany alliance, and as such our current agreement is a three way draw. We would be very willing to open that to a four way on the same understanding. As for your possible SC gains, Bulgaria, Greece, Rumania and Sevastopol would be obvious locations for Turkish occupation. Let me know your thoughts.\r\n1 TURKEY -> ITALY: I was hoping to speak to you actually. Austria has betrayed me twice, and now it is my turn to betray them. I have given the illusion that we are in am alliance, but I only said that so.he would free up units from around me. Now I am much more set up to attack him if I so wish.\n\nMake no mistake, I am fully against him. Tell me what you need me to do and I would love to end in a draw with the three of you.\r\n2 ITALY -> TURKEY: Excellent. Well obviously at the moment I need you to prove your intentions so I'll leave that to you, but might I suggest slipping Aeg into Bul and Eastern to Aeg?

What do you think?\r\n1 TURKEY -> FRANCE: The idea has merit.\n\nMay I request access to the Tyr Sea, by the way?

Are you still with us?!\r\n1 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: Yes, I'm still with you. I'm going to do my best to hold strong against France and England, but it's anybody's game right now. Except Turkey's.\r\n2 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: I wouldn't give Russia much hope either, personally!\n\nI'd be ecstatic with a three-way draw and a middle power alliance has made all the sense in the world to me since day one, so that is my goal... Hopefully Italy will see the light and realize if he leaves France unchecked that France may very well end up with 14,000 points to his name!\r\n3 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: So, can you imagine Ska attacking Norway? What if Mos supported Norway to Stp while Norwegian slid into Norway? Baltic could cover Swe while Kiel covers Den, Ruh covers Kiel and Sil covers Mun... This could get you to seven centers and a build! Think about it and let me know since Mos hitting Sev would be useful as well, but the highest priority is keeping you as strong as possible, which will also result in you being able to slow down the E/F as much as possible...\r\n4 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: I am 100% aligned with a central powers alliance; France and England are, quite obviously, my biggest threats right now, and I must handle them. I'd love to take St. Pete; I can see that it would help both of us immensely, and if there's something I've learned this game, it's that you put a dying dog out of its misery. If Moscow will support Norway to St. Pete, I will move Norway to St. Pete and NWG to Norway per your suggestion. Similarly, Silesia will move to Munich to help cover my home centers. I've thought long and hard about this, and it is a great plan. I will gladly take your support into St. Pete.\n\nFrance will get, at most, one build this turn, and after Italy's moves I can see that we are in a delicate situation. In the interest of equal growth, would you consider letting Italy hold onto Trieste, Smyrna and Ankara so that he can equip his western front with enough firepower to push back France? I would consider it a long-term investment in our continued viability, and a strong strategy to contain E/F. I eagerly await your response.\r\n5 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: Great, glad you are onboard! Moscow will support you into Stp, that works for both of us as you suggest. France is a HUGE concern and I am in agreement on Italy keeping Trieste, Smy and Ank. Glad the three of us finally appear to be on the same page, I've been pushing this Central Powers alliance since day one, here's to our success!! :-)\r\n",

It would get me a build in the north where we really need it (if I can hang onto Vienna) or mitigate my losses if I don't.

Once you've picked up that build we should disband your southern fleet so you can pick up another build in the north and really press your advantage. I can't advance much at the moment until pressure on the north end of Italy's line or a French expedition in the Med leaves Serbia vulnerable, so I will just hold my ground.\r\n4 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: Sounds good.

First off, you're not going to get that SC because I'm going to be supporting Russia into Trieste (as I warned you).\n\nPropping me up longer would have given France and Germany a chance to come in and relieve pressure. The Russia-turkey juggernaut is on the roll, and you're next. What's worse, you've shown yourself to be totally untrustworthy. I've been communicating with France and Germany and telling them how closely we're working together, so they know that you'll sell out a close ally for just 1 SC.\r\n2 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I saw no signs of France or germany coming in to relieve pressure. Germany in fact told me he wasn't planning on moving east. His moves in the spring show that. it was clear to me that regardless of whether or not i retreated from Trieste, you couldn't hold off Russia and Turkey and I couldn't help you since my fleets couldnt support your primarily inland holdings. Thus, i needed to get an extra SC so that I could build a third army and stand a better chance against the juggernaut.\n\nIts fair enough that you are helping Russia to take Trieste-- i believed your warning and i guess i expected such action. Obviously, I would rather you spend your resources slowing down the russians or the turks and I would help you in any way I could if you were doing that.\r\n3 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: France has a big northern fleet, and that makes Scandinavia his next likely target. Meanwhile, Russia has troops on 3 sides of Germany, so he better figure it out. Notice that Germany and France both moved fleets out of England--i'm pretty sure they're on the same page.\n\nBut about us: I want to stay in the game more than I want to punish you. So if you can explain to me how that is going to happen, I'm listening. But you'll also have to tell me why I shouldn't assume you'll stab me.\r\n4 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I will support your serbian army into greece with F Ion and F Alb.\ni will also support your [968909] army into vienna if you want, though i cant imagine that will succeed.\n\ni won't stab you because i cant stab you...you only have centre right now, and i cant get to it. i also wont stab you because i now fully realize the strength of turkey/russia working together. before i thought i could turn russia against turkey, but ive lost faith in that.\r\n5 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I appreciate your offer, but it won't work...Turkey can cut your support in Ion and provide a support from either Bul or Aeg.\r\n",

You move on Bulgaria, this causes a bounce and blocks any possible Austrian retreat. If possible I will move on Turkey also to weaken them and after I betray Turkey will turn back on me.

I mean, it seems that our strongest moveset is precisely Spain moving to Gascony, so that we can ensure we triumph against Brest in the Autumn.\n\nMore specifically, if we order Por-mao, Spa-gas and Par S Spa-gas, England can bounce Por-mao, but can't stop Spa-gas. In the Autumn, England will be forced to choose between support holding Brest or bouncing Por-mao. Even if England decides to defend Brest, this means Por-mao succeeds and we're absolutely certain to get Brest next Spring.\n\nWhat do you say? Burgundy, as far as I'm concerned, is definitely to be a DMZ!\r\n2 ITALY -> GERMANY: Meanwhile, I'll see if I can get the new fleet to move West, so that England can't hope to retaliate against you.\n\nThe issue regarding the East is a bit more complicated, though. I can stall Turkey in the Sea, but how can we best support Austria? Even if Austria can't be propped up indefinitely, we should delay its collapse as much as possible. Do you think we risk Trieste falling and order Ven-tyr? If Trieste makes it, our position is surely stronger to push Russia back.\r\n3 GERMANY -> ITALY: Ok spain to gas. I guess you need me to hold back the russians & turks, so i am a better ally for you than the brits.\r\n4 ITALY -> GERMANY: To be perfectly honest, I think you're an ally without which I can't hope to stay in one piece. I've being doing my best to prop Austria, as I can't hope to withstand them without Austria. If, or rather, when, Austria is further weakened, I can't possibly hope to hold my own against Russia and Turkey by my own (nor, as a matter of fact, can you). To make things worse, Russia does not answer me at all, meaning I can't possibly drive a wedge between them. If one of us goes under the bus, so does the other.\r\n",

I got a message from England, asking if I'd support him into MAO, and he'd support me to Por because England wants to survive. Fair enough, but then Germany sends me a message saying I should consider having England go to MAO, it could help, and even though last time we talked he said he would be okay with me going to Tyrolia, he now asks if it can wait a season or two &and& wants to make sure it's okay if he can go to Gascony, etc., etc. The Germany has the Englishman in his hip pocket, England asked me to help him because England wants to survive this game, but it's not because he's offering to help me solo (which he clearly cannot offer), it's because he has already cut a deal with Germany to help the German solo. Russia may have even cut the same deal, so beware!\n\nPS - Germany once said something to me about being afraid of you moving into Finland, that may actually be a good options at some point, the less comfortable Germany is right now, the less likely he goes for a solo and the more likely we three-way draw.\n\nThoughts?\r\n1 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Those are some interesting developments. Let me mull it over. Also, I can't chat much since I'm at work now, but I'll be on later tonight.\r\n2 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Sounds good. Germany is saying he will draw for sure, but what else is he supposed to say? I'm watching him closely, hopefully I'm just over-reacting.\r\n3 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Overall, I still think we're in pretty good shape. We don't need to push Germany back to be on par with us, we only just need to ensure that he stays under 18 Scs.\n\nOf course, to just hold your end of the line keeping what you currently have, you would need to get fleets into Gol, WMS, and Naf.\n\nWorst-case would be if England and France did everything they could to help Germany solo, which in the near-term would be to help him put a power-3 attack on Spa for the fall. Hopefully, some diplomatic words can rectify this situation. Perhaps, ask Germany not to enter Gas if his intent is to merely draw. Also, England and France might be jaded enough to refuse to cooperate with Germany. How does that situation look as of now?\r\n4 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: On my end of the line, I certainly hope that Russia hasn't made a deal with Germany to make things difficult, but I think I found a set of moves that'll work relatively safely regardless. Tyrolia is a key territory and I can force you in from Ven this Spring, but Boh and even War aren't critical, as we could also just fall back to the Tyr, Vie, Gal, Ukr, Mos line. As long as you hold your end, that would still leave us with 18 Scs combined.\r\n5 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Germany said he'd send me a long response tonight, so we'll see. I'll ask Germany about Gas, I've already told him I don't want him there, so I will stand my ground and hope for the best. I can support myself to Tyrolia, so no worries there, you can use your units to do as you see fit.\r\n",

Taking Bur out of the equation must have been a tough choice.\nHave you spoken with Italy? So long as you can get him to back off a little, Germany will not make much progress. I'm pretty sure he intends Munich to move in Sil.\r\n2 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: My Bur disband wasn't pro-gERMANY, in case you though so. I need the MAO fleet to move to Spain, to prevent Mars from going there. Germany has 4 units next to Burgundy, so my army being there couldn't have prevented him from taking it, , and I may have been forced to disband a unit in Spring, which would guarantee me a SC loss in Autumn. Im still very much interested in working with you, the sooner the better, because Germany is the biggest long term threat, whatever short term deals he may offer to any of us.\r\n3 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: Okay. Well I'm not hearing much from Germany. Either he's really busy as he claims, or I was right and he's setting himself up to change the tides again.\nI will do my best to secure NTH this year.

Austria's role in this game could also change if Italy was convinced to play otherwise than with Germany.\r\n4 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: Yeah, I'll definitely keep you informed, both on Italy and otherwise. As of now, Italy seems to agree that Germany should be stopped, and had agreed to help me if I let him take Mars. I will probably support him into Mars this turn, with Gas, while using MAO to cover Spain (that's why i needed to destroy the Bur army).\nOf course, you'd told me that Germany was going to give Mars to Italy anyway, so Italy will actually get to make a neutral move, and potentially side with either of me and Germany in the next move.\r\n",

Germany have to defend both Kiel and Ber, so I hope Pic could move to Bur this turn.\nAbout Mars, I will move Gas with Spa support, so if Austria support me or cut Pie support it can work, but I am not that sure about Austria real intentions, so that&s why a support for Spa will come on good time.....\r\n2 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: Sounds good.

Russia is nearly demanding I help him get a German center this year, this after stealing Norway from me. I'm going to shift units on him just as soon as we are a bit more stable, which should be soon with Italy losing a unit this year.
