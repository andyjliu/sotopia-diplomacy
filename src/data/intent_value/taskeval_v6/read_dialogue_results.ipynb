      "1 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: Hey Russia, I'm glad we could work together last turn. Supporting Sweden to Denmark sounds like a good idea, but I was thinking maybe we could also discuss supporting Budapest to Vienna? That would really help me out.\n",
      "2 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: That's an interesting idea, supporting Budapest to Vienna could definitely help you out. However, I think supporting Sweden to Denmark would be more beneficial for me in the long run. Would you be willing to compromise and support both moves?\n",
      "3 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I think supporting both moves could be beneficial for both of us. How about we support Sweden to Denmark and Budapest to Vienna, and I'll also support your move in Silesia to Berlin? That way, we can both gain something from this turn.\n",
      "4 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: That sounds like a great plan, Turkey! Supporting both Sweden to Denmark and Budapest to Vienna would really strengthen our positions. And with your support in Silesia to Berlin, I'll be able to make some significant gains this turn. Let's make it happen!\n",
      "5 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I'm glad we could come to an agreement, Russia. Let's make sure to execute our plans perfectly this turn. I'll be keeping an eye on the board, and I expect our alliance to continue to benefit both of us.\n",

      "8 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: That's an interesting idea, Turkey. Supporting Greece to Bulgaria could be a good move. However, I think I'd like to discuss supporting Rumania to Bulgaria instead. What do you think about that?\n",

For the potential move in the north, I was thinking we could discuss supporting Sweden to Norway or Denmark to Norway. What do you think about those options?\n",
      "13 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I think supporting both Greece to Bulgaria and Rumania to Bulgaria is a great idea, Russia. Let's focus on executing those moves this turn. In terms of the potential move in the north, I'm leaning towards supporting Sweden to Norway. What do you think about that?\n",
      "14 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I'm glad we're on the same page, Turkey. Supporting both Greece to Bulgaria and Rumania to Bulgaria will definitely strengthen our positions. And I think supporting Sweden to Norway is a great move in the north. Let's make it happen!\n",
