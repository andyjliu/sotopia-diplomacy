As for me, I don't mind stabs as much as I get annoyed by allies that miss key turns. ~N~ ~N~ I still need to see Germany out of this one, and the less help you give him, the better. I understand your concerns with my units in the north. I've been trying to figure out how we can keep ourselves safe without inflating the units. Would the following work: ~N~ ~N~ St. Pete back to Moscow, Finland to St. Pete, Gulf of Bothnia holds. ~N~ ~N~ Sweden holds, Norway holds. Kiel takes Berlin (or perhaps we work it out so you get Berlin), I move the rest of my fleets back. We can then bounce in Finland if we feel the need. ~N~ ~N~ The problem I see is that if you remained allied with Austria, that is a bigger problem for me that my alliance with France is for you. France doesn't really factor in it for you, since you by association have Italy on your side with no southern threat. If you build Warsaw, you can move that back to Moscow easily, or to Purssia, while Austria moves to Boh. It's a tough position for me. ~N~ ~N~ Of course, Austria could still be fake stabbing, like he pretended he would years ago. Who am I to tell? ~N~ ~N~ Thoughts?\r\n1 RUSSIA -> ENGLAND: OK, two things. Firstly, I stand by my need to maintain Germany in Berlin. I don't think you eliminating Germany as a power is as important to you as the opportunity of providing a land outlet to Russia. I am skeptical. ~N~ ~N~ Secondly, I am in favor of demilitarization of Scandinavia; however, not to your prescription, which includes me retreating and you holding. Let's continue talking on that. If we are to demilitarize Scand, those units must go somewhere... ~N~ ~N~ So, here's a thought we might want to begin kicking around... You really want me to stab Austria, eh? Well, I think you should stab France. Would you be interested in a complete double shift? North vs. South? I think we would have an advantage, especially if Italy continues its anti-FRENCH moves.\r\n2 ENGLAND -> RUSSIA: I am interested, but the problem is if you maintain Germany, and Italy is still fighting, France falls quickly while you and Austria potentially gain crucial ground. Ideally we both shift at the same time, but it is very dangerous for me to stab my only ally when you have three. Hence why I need Germany out of this, one way or the other.\r\n",

Austria and you can cooperate against Warsaw on the east while I can move to Marseilles-piedmont and help Austria to defeat Italy.\r\n2 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Yes! How good does that look :-)\nI think it would be great for you to start working with Austria as well. The three of us could hook up and take this game now I'm sure.\r\n3 FRANCE -> GERMANY: We have two options regarding west. Channel can convoy to Wales army from Picardie, or support Hel to north sea. You need to be careful not to lose Denmark this turn. I will help Austria in the south then, three of us will be enough to control the game, you are right.\r\n4 GERMANY -> FRANCE: You must take Wales this time. I did think of moving Bal to Den might I might move Kiel with Bal supp. My concern right now is still Russia and that he might gain the Baltic Sea, which will put pressure on my Scs next year.\r\n5 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I will convoy to British island with Channel in that case. I hope that pressure on England will be sufficient enough so he turn all units toward me and leave only Russian units for you to worry about. I looked at some diplomacy articles about strategy and you are correct, Baltic sea should stay in German hand at all costs. You could use Austrian help in dealing with Russia, so only country that can be influenced to help Austria is Turkey. I will try to talk to Turkey, he may exploit Italian and Russian weak garrison in the south and help Austria a bit. Austria is maybe beginner player so he could use your tactical advice.\r\n6 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I've heard from Turkey and he is not happy with Russia now (that fleet in Black Sea did it!) so I think is interested in working with Austria.\r\n7 FRANCE -> GERMANY: he supported Sevastopol to Romania so he must have known that only place for Romania fleet to move is the Black sea.\r\n8 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Good spot - hadn't noticed that!\r\n9 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I think I will move Kie to Den with two supports.\nIf Russia attacks Bal with both units I can retreat to Ber (or potentially Liv if he shifts Gob and no units in Stp neighbours!).\nSil is supporting austrian attack on War.\r\n10 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I think attack is best way of defense so in your place I would play:\nHel-north sea\nKiel-denmark\nBaltic-sweden\n\nThat way you will defend Denmark, and stop them from repositioning their forces. That would prove valuable next year, because they have numerical superiority in fleets, and only way they can use this superiority is to shift units around.\r\n11 GERMANY -> FRANCE: That's an interesting spin on what I was going to - use the supports to attack.\nI like it and will give it a try, as you say, may prevent Eng/Rus gaining control in the water.\r\n12 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Wt least England will have to disband something at the end of the year when you gain Lvp, which will help...\r\n13 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I hope we will have some luck in next years. The worst thing that could happen to us is eastern triple (Turkey, Italy, Russia) before we kill England. With Liverpool in my control I plan to build new fleet to swing north and try to brake through to Norwegian sea and tie up considerable English forces there.\n\nI think that in the next year if pressure on your borders remain strong we could pull little trick. Holland could move to Belgium in the fall and get yourself new army in Berlin to fight with Russia. If things are becoming really serious we might even consider moving Burgundy to Bohemia, but that would be last resort I guess. You have strong defensive position that is hard to crack, so our prime concern is Austria. He is in the middle of 3 way attack. It would be great if he could take Warsaw this turn, but that is unlikely.\r\n14 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Austria gone a little quiet this turn, but I know he has Gal-war in place, which I am supporting.\nTurkey still making friendly noises - will be interesting to see how he moves this time.\r\n15 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I am thinking about convoy to Britain, or supporting your fleet to north sea from Hel. They would both be great moves if they succeed. England can stop only one of those, so there is 50-50 chance of success. For now I have convoy in place.\r\n16 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I think best is to leave Marseilles open for build...if Austria is in problems I could build fleet there. If not I will move army there in spring.\r\n",

I think we have a good plan: I move Fin to St. Pete with support from Norway while NWG moves to NAO and London supports Belgium to ENG.

Also, since I have the army in Prussia, I can more readily support myself south while you use your additional build to get another fleet with which to fight France.

        "intent_dialogue": "0 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: What the hell? Why do you always do everything agnst what we discussed? The idea was to destroy Holland, and move Burgudny to Paris, supported by Picardy and Brest.\n/sigh\nOh well, it was your loss this time.\n\nTo remedy this, I will be convoying to Belgium this. In autumn, you'll support me in with Picardy and Munich, while I use Ruhr. That way, we get Burgundy back, so we'll be back where we should've been...\r\n1 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Take the mid Atlantic and convoy to somewhere on Iberia, I'm not putting off taking Belgium any longer. Though in hindsight, I could've moved Burgundy>Belgium, but I'll put that up to stupidity on my part.\nNext turn: Kiel to Munich, supported by Ruhr, Picardy and Brest to Paris (Just in case we get lucky).\nThen next turn, Ruhr to Burgundy, so we can take Paris.\r\n2 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: /sigh\nI'm not trying like instate a totalitarian dictatorship in this alliance. My ranking isn't this high for nothing...I know what I'm doing. Every time you've gone against what I've told you, the plan resulted in disaster, and you know that. If you begin to start listening to me, we might actually be able to end this game in a 17-17 draw like I originally planned. You see, I'm trying to balance out my wins, defeats, and draws at 6. So far the former are at 6, and draws are at 4. I am about to draw my other game. So all I need to do is to draw this game to achieve my goal.\nSo, if you could do both of a favor, could please stop putting SC obtainment as your primary goal? We are going for logic, and most effective plan here. France shouldn't take this long to defeat... So, let me explain you my logics so you know I'm not randomly throwing around crap to get me Sc's. This is the plan, as I see it. Picardy and Brest support hold each other, allowing Irish Sea to get to MAO safely. Getting a fleet to MAO gurantees a succesful move from Belgium to Burgundy, still allowing you Belgium. So, end result is, you still get Belgium by the build cycle, and we're in a stronger position, etc.. If you need me to re-explain any of this, I'd be happy to. But, do you see where my exsasperation lies? We are allies, I am doing stuff on the agenda of both of us, whereas you are looking at yourself. If we are to be strong allies, we need to be communicating well, and in complete understanding of each others logics. At this point, your moves seem very illogical to me... Sorry to be so forceful in this message, but I've been trying to get this point across to you in the past messages, and I don't think I'm explaining myself clear enough for you to understand.\r\n3 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Well look at it from my point of view, I have an eastern border that is 100% undefended. If Russia, Austria OR Italy decide to attack me, there's little I can do (And I don't want to think about what would happen if 2 of them joined forces.)\nNow, join that with the fact that you seem to be doing all that is possible to hold Sc's from me (No point dancing around that topic, that's just how it seems), and I get more than a bit worried.\n\nNow, I do see logic in your plan, so I'll go with it. To clarify the plan on my end: Holland holds, Picardy supports Brest, Kiel moves to Munich with support from Ruhr.\n\nHowever, I do have a suggestion. If you keep the army in London this turn (Not an attempt to keep it out of Belgium, just bear with me!) and move Ruhr to Burgundy after we take Munich, that means we have an army in Burgundy at the same time, /and/ we have an army in London which can be convoyed to France's rear. And that means we wont have an army sitting in Ruhr doing a whole lot of nothing.\r\n4 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: And I do apologise for frustrating you, that's never been my intention!\r\n5 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: That wouldn't work it; there wouldn't be enough units to get into Burgundy. Taking Belgium in the Spring of Fall will still result in the same outcome; you'll get a build. Plus, you're going to need that build anyways, so I need to make sure you get it. Munich will be retreating to Berlin, so to completely get the French out of your territory. you'll have to be building in either Kiel or Brest. Basically, you're going to get Belgium anyways, its just the matter when; in spring, or fall. Secondally, Picardy support holds Brest, and Brest supports Picardy; we're not going to go for Paris this turn.\r\n6 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I'm not too worried at this point as to whether I got Belgium in Spring or Autumn, I just thought it'd be better than just having your army sitting in Ruhr without doing anything. If we attack Gascony and Paris (No chance of taking them, but just to make sure they don't support) then you could move into Burgundy with support from Munich.\nAs you say, it's all about getting the most units possible in France.\r\n7 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Well, Ruhr is needed to gurantee Belgium to Burgundy; there's not enough supports to make it into Burgundy as it stands. Does that make sense? Also, the probability of convoying units into Iberia isn't very high, the outcome could very well end up having that army still in London, back where we started. If London goes through Belgium, that puts an extra unit in the French territory, no matter what. I think we've been taking too many gambles; it'd be best to stick with what'll work for sure, so we can finish up France ASAP, and pursue other people like Austria and Russia...\r\n8 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Well, if we attack Paris and Gascony, there will only be the unit in Burgundy to defend it, so we can take it with Ruhr/Munich. Belgium wont be threatened at all, as it'll be behind the front lines. So we'll have 3 units directly able to attack France (As we would with the other plan) /and/ we have a unit that can actually do something against France instead of sitting in the rear.\r\n9 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Though if we do that, I wont be able to take Berlin back.\nI guess your plan wins!\r\n10 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Okay, confirmed, dont forget to support hold Brest from Picardy.\r\n11 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: And don't forget to support attack Munich from Kiel ;)\r\n",

I can use this fleet, though, although I'd rather have had an army, especially with Italy building his army in Venice. Can the fleet help you in any way?\r\n2 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: No the fleet can't help me in any way. We're looking at the same map, and there only so many fleets can be useful against France. Your build says you are coming at me. I cannot interpret it any other way. Are you implying I should heed France and Russia's request for me to ally with them? I've been playing cat and mouse with them so far, since you've had a knife to my throat with all of the fleets, but now I feel as though I should stick to them instead since your attack on me is inevitable. Please clear my head if my logic is flawed. I'd much rather ride your coattails, but I don't want to be a fool here.\r\n3 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: There's a lot to talk about, and I'm writing up a response. I hope to have it to you in an hour or so.\r\n4 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I think you're being fairly reasonable, but you may have overlooked Burgundy; nonetheless, I respect your concern. I'm sure Russia and France would love to use you; you're in a commanding position against France and Russia doesn't have anything to lose, but he's upset I took Norway. I suppose it's unfortunate he Nmrd.\n\nYou have the opportunity to grab Denmark, Holland, or Belgium, or even Norway if you can get Russia's help. I trust you, but I know it must be tempting. I'm willing to work around this in a way that is profitable to both of us.\n\nKiel at the moment can protect Holland and Denmark. I have to think long-term, where I can expand, and what the end-game will look like. I've already explained why I won't assault England; I'd leave myself wide open for Austria and Italy, and even Russia and France. I would have preferred Italy to have built a fleet against France instead of that stupid army against me, and I wish I had built an army instead. Again, sorry. Let's look forward.\n\nI'm pretty sure that Russia's going to support himself into Norway. I know you're nervous about me taking NTH; but if I wanted to, wouldn't I have done it already?\n\nI'd like to make a plan that guarantees you at least one SC by the end of the year--even if it's one of mine--and also keeps us on solid footing against France and Russia. Would you like to draft a plan like that?\r\n5 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I'll only consider a plan with you if you guarantee only 2 fleets bordering the North Sea. Keeping a fleet in Kiel is not a threat to me, and I understand how comforting it can be to Germany... but 4 fleets is a bit overkill.\r\n6 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: That's perfect for me. Here's my proposal:\n\nSwe to Fin. Norway hold. Ska to Swe. Kiel & Belgium bounce in Holland. Wal & Lon S NTH to ENG.\n\nThis leaves only Norway and Belgium bordering NTH, puts you on the offensive against France, and allows you to protect all your home centers. If you can commit to leaving NTH empty, I can commit to pulling my fleets away.\n\nIf you like this plan, I will enter my orders.\r\n7 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Clever. I offered the 2 border fleets as a first step to dmz north sea. I'd rather not give you the option of a juicy retreat. How about nths support hold norway, and london takes EC with wales and belgium support?\r\n8 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Clever. I offered the 2 border fleets as a first step to dmz north sea.

We need to discuss the Vie/Tri/Alb problem. I can always offer support, from Budapest if it is needed. ~N~ K\r\n1 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: Sounds good - G/I is in the way of both of us, but France isn't in a position to attack Italy right now (and doesn't look to be going after Germany either, unless he suddenly moves Belgium to Holland, Picardy to Belgium, Burgandy to Ruhr, and Marseilles to Burgandy and gets you to hit Berlin to break support of Munich for him). Suggesting to France that he could pick up two centers this turn might get him to bite, and F Mar built at the end of the year would help against Italy. ~N~ ~N~ I think Italy will hold both Trieste and Vienna this turn, so if you support Serbia into Trieste, I'm sure Venice will be holding it so Italy will keep it - is there any way you can move around to occupy Bohemia, Galicia, and Budapest? This would put you in a good position to take Vienna if I hit Trieste with Serbia. I am considering moving Greece to Albania, and Aegean to Greece, forcing Albania to retreat to Adriatic. I'm also considering moving Smyrna out to Eastern Med and hopefully getting into Ionian soon. Not sure if it's worth risking losing Greece and getting it back again next turn, though, since Italy might anticipate and use Ionian to bounce me out of Eastern Med.\r\n2 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: France has been hectoring me since the begining of this game to attack germany, now that I have made the first moves I am pretty sure that he'll jump on the chance to prosper from the fall of germany. I will suggest to him however that he also considers moving A Bur - Ruh to place pressure on Munich. ~N~ ~N~ I to am pretty sure Italy will place support on both Vie & Tri this season. I was already considering moving a Gal - Sil, but am thinking seriously about amending this to Gal - Boh. regarding Serbia I would be grateful if you would consider supporting my army budapest - hold. this is just in case Germany's A Vie decides to support A Tri - Bud.\r\n3 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I can hold Budapest. I think you're probably right, although I also wouldn't be surprised if Trieste hits Serbia in order to break support of Greece. But Aegean will support Greece, so Serbia will be free to support the hold.\r\n",

Thanks\r\n1 FRANCE -> ITALY: You want to work with me so much that you incite others to attack me? You thought it wouldn't get back to me?\r\n2 ITALY -> FRANCE: I figured it probably would, but wanted to throw it out to England just in case they wanted to take a stab to get the win. I have my back against the wall by just joining (not that I'm complaining - I love the challenge!), just have to play all of my options.\n\nI've gone over all of the turns to try and get reads on everyone, and you've done a great job so far, so kudos to you. The \"can I move to Tyrolia\" question was a great move.\n\nGood luck. You're in the driver's seat, so you probably won't need it.\r\n3 FRANCE -> ITALY: Not really - this match is far from won. If we were to work together what would you suggest?\r\n4 ITALY -> FRANCE: That's the tough part - for this turn, there's not a whole lot I can offer you other than just being a pest to Austria and Russia in the south.\n\nA potential plan could be for you to move Munich to Silesia and Bur to Munich so you can slowly hack away at Austria. I can move Ionian to Adr and use Venice and Adr to help you into Trieste eventually (although you'd need to get into Vienna first to make a difference). It would be an arduous battle, but at least would let you keep your troops consolidated rather than having to chase me around in the Mediterranean oceans.\n\nUp to you, though. I certainly wouldn't blame you for refusing the plan, but I do think that I can help you out here (and stay alive myself).\r\n5 FRANCE -> ITALY: I have no intention of attacking Ven this turn as I am sure you would have some assurances regarding support or bounces. The game is entering the interesting phase, and provided you do not move your Ionian West I am content to see what opportunities arise over the next turn or so\r\n6 FRANCE -> ITALY: England is the one in the box seat - not me :)\r\n7 ITALY -> FRANCE: I can agree to not moving Ionian west.

Is there anything I can do to make you more comfortable leaving it open. Probably not but I thought I'd ask.\r\n2 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: you could move bulgaria to cons, leave bulg open ...and then every turn i move serbia into bularia and you move cons into bulgaria. ~N~ ~N~ but the soon to be fleeet in the black sea needs to move to the med right? so we can set up some safe but using less units border system after the fleet has moved away.\r\n3 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: england and russia have a much better system that us, look at norway and st petes, free of units. can we work towrds that?. if you have one unit in cons and i have one unit in either serbia or rumania(but not both) then we will both free up a unit to do other stuff\r\n4 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: I would like to move the fleet from Greece at some point, so it might make sense to leave Serbia, Bulgaria, Greece free of units. You have a unit in Rumania and I have units in Seva and Con. ~N~ ~N~ I'm withdrawing from Con. this turn. Next turn I should (baring something unforseen) withdraw from Bulgaria.\r\n5 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: if you move the army to sevas, next turn you could make a move on moscow, i will help if you help me with warsaw\r\n6 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: I want to discuss with you end game scenarios. a 2 way draw is impossible for all players, draws cannot be 2 way, it is too easy for one player, especially a stabber like england to simply grab an extra sc and win the game, ~N~ now the way the league points are set up if for example you and england go for a 2 way draw and england grabs that one extra sc to give him 18 to your 16 sc then he will get ALL the points and you will be on zero points, same with poor germnay. at the end of the 5 games IF you are on the same number of points as another player then the league will calculate your SC gained in the 5 games. so in that limited sense having lots of Sc and surviving is good. but it is in a very limited way . ~N~ ~N~ england is going for the win, he will crush france this year and next, russia and germany are on the way out. that leaves you, me england and italy. italy will try to talk you into a 2 way draw but i would be VERY careful about that, 2 way draws are next to impossible, it would be very much in his interest to ask you for that then go for the win. however 3 way draws are much easier to make. i propose we use our alliance to finish off russia and italy and present england with a strong united front that he cannot break into. then give him the chance for a 3 way draw. 4 way if [151052] is to be included in it. ~N~ ~N~ If you stab me i think england will win the game and if i stab you then i think england will win the game.\r\n7 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: Nice job taking Munich. ~N~ ~N~ I completely agree on all points. If nothing else Russia and England have (at least temporarily) a strong relationship so we'd be at serious disadvantage if we each tried to go at it alone. ~N~ ~N~ I'm moving my black sea fleet to Con this next turn. I know that it is somewhat of a risk on your part, but if you could move the army from Rumania to Ukraine that would be huge. I'm sure me and Russia will bounce in Moscow this next turn we could take (I think) warsaw or moscow next year if there is any army in Ukraine. ~N~ ~N~\r\n8 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: Should we call off hostilities with [151052] and try to get him to fight England? Should we continue to keep pressure on him?\r\n9 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: keep pressure maybe. i cant see [151052] fighting england just yet, they are too far away and also you will have all these fleets, best use for them is in the med sea. i hope you plan to build fleets from now on. if you take moscow and i warsaw this year or next will you build another fleet and i will build an army in vienna?\r\n10 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: [151052] wants (well according to him) to make a deal with england. i dont know if this is a lie or not. he told me england was quite hostile and pushy a few years ago. but i think there is a lot of reasons for england and italy to become partners. england would be glad that italy can stop your navies and they also can team up to take france out. we may ne dup with a four way draw- italy and england and austria and turkey. russia will be stabbed by england when we take moscow i think. england wont want turkish armies near his safe swedish and norway provinces.\r\n11 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: end up\r\n12 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: i will need to think about rumania. might be better off for me to use galica. i get a build this year due to munich so i will build in either budapest or vienna\r\n13 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: I will build primarily fleets from now one (I can't guarantee that I will never build an army again.) ~N~ ~N~ It would be very useful if you would move to Ukraine, although I understand why you wouldn't. I'm not sure if I would do it if I was in position.\r\n14 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: you will move black sea to cons and smyna to armenia and sevas to moscow? then i will build in [246553] and move to galica. galica to move to ukraine. ~N~ ~N~ my rumania can support my own unit into ukraine. that way if he builds in moscow or warsaw then he cannot block my advance into ukraine. i am aiming to get warsaw this year if possible.\r\n15 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: Yes A(SEV) ->MOS, F(BLA)-> CON, A(SMY)->ARM. ~N~ ~N~ I was thinking about moving F(ION)->APU and F(GRE)->ION but since Italy and England are probably working together my guess is that Italy will try to retake the Ionian this next turn. I will hold off any advances in the med until the third fleet gets down there.\r\n",

I don't mind your fleets that much & you haven't turned them on me before.\n\nSeeing as France thinks I'm working with them, a support into Mars from Pie and one from Tyrr into Tunis would work, I believe, and be rather effective.

Germany have to defend both Kiel and Ber, so I hope Pic could move to Bur this turn.\nAbout Mars, I will move Gas with Spa support, so if Austria support me or cut Pie support it can work, but I am not that sure about Austria real intentions, so that&s why a support for Spa will come on good time.....\r\n2 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: Sounds good. MAO will support hold at Spain and I'll try to take Kiel while you try to take Mar. I'm unsure of Austria's intentions as well, but hopefully one of us gets a build this year even though I have a bad feeling neither of us will. :(\r\n3 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: The Russian is really pissing me off. Russia is nearly demanding I help him get a German center this year, this after stealing Norway from me. I'm going to shift units on him just as soon as we are a bit more stable, which should be soon with Italy losing a unit this year. You should be able to take Mar next year, I'd imagine, can't wait for both of us to break out and join Turkey (and maybe Austria) in wrapping this game up, it's been pretty slow and frustrating, but it will all be worth it in the end! :)\r\n4 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: I hope so, we have been in the defense for a long time.\nAbout Russia, I try to get something from him, but he just answered that he don&t have nothing to talk about with me. Not a good sign I think. Hope A/T crush him first and then start to fight....\r\n5 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I'm not a big fan of the Russian lately either, I have a very bad feeling about him as well...\r\n",
