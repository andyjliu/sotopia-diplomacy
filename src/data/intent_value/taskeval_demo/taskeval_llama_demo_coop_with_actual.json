If you move your army from BUD to TRI, I'll move my army from ALB to SER, and we can split the spoils. What do you say?\n1 RUSSIA -> ITALY: That's an interesting proposal, Italy. However, I was thinking of moving my army from BUD to WAR to support my other unit in UKR. Would you be willing to move your army from ALB to GRE instead, and we can work together to take down Austria from different angles?\n2 ITALY -> RUSSIA: That's a good point, Russia. Moving your army from BUD to WAR would definitely put pressure on Austria. If I move my army from ALB to GRE, we can still work together to take down Austria, but we'd be coming at it from different angles. I like that idea.

Would you be willing to support my move to GAS with your army in RUH? Perhaps we could work out a deal that would allow us to both gain an advantage?\n1 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Hello France, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your desire to move into GAS, I'm afraid I have other plans for my army in RUH. However, I'm open to discussing alternative moves that could benefit both our countries. I'm planning to move my army from RUH to BEL, which could potentially create an opportunity for us to work together. Perhaps we could discuss a joint effort to take down England, who seems to be getting a bit too powerful?\n2 FRANCE -> GERMANY: That's an interesting proposal, Germany. I think a joint effort to take down England could be beneficial for both of us. However, I'd like to clarify that my priority is still to move into GAS. Would you be willing to support my move there if I agree to work with you to take down England? Perhaps we could discuss a simultaneous move into HOL and LVP to put pressure on England's northern flank.\n3 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I understand your desire to move into GAS, France. However, I'm afraid I cannot support your move there this turn. My priority is to secure BEL and put pressure on England. But I'm willing to work with you to take down England, as I mentioned earlier. If you agree to support my move into BEL, I can offer you a deal that would benefit both our countries in the long run. Perhaps we could discuss a simultaneous move into HOL and LVP, as you suggested, but only after I've secured BEL.\n4 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I understand your concerns, Germany. However, I'm not willing to give up on GAS just yet. How about this: I'll support your move into BEL, and in return, you'll support my move into GAS next turn? This way, we can both achieve our goals and still work together to take down England.\n5 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, France. However, I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with supporting your move into GAS next turn. Can I propose an alternative?

This way, we can both achieve our goals without having to make promises that might be difficult to keep.\n6 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I see what you're getting at, Germany. While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, I think I need a bit more assurance that you'll hold up your end of the bargain. Can you offer me something more concrete, like a guarantee that you won't move into GAS for the next two turns? That way, I can be certain that I have the time and space to focus on taking down England with you.\n7 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I understand your concerns, France. I'm willing to make a compromise. If you support my move into BEL this turn, I'll not only guarantee that I won't move into GAS next turn, but I'll also support your move into GAS the turn after that. This way, we can both achieve our goals and still work together to take down England. What do you think?\n8 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I think we're making progress, Germany. Your guarantee that you won't move into GAS next turn and will support my move into GAS the turn after that is a promising development. I'm willing to support your move into BEL this turn, but I'd like to clarify that our joint effort to take down England is still on the table. Let's work together to put pressure on England's northern flank and make the most of this opportunity.\n9 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I'm glad we've reached an understanding, France. I'll make sure to follow through on my promises. Let's work together to take down England and secure our positions on the board. I'll make the necessary moves to support your efforts, and I expect the same in return. Let's make this a successful alliance.\n10 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I'm glad we've reached an understanding, Germany. Let's make sure to follow through on our promises and work together to take down England. I'll make the necessary moves to support your efforts, and I expect the same in return. Let's make this a successful alliance.\n11 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I'm glad we've come to an agreement, France. Now that we have a plan in place, I'd like to discuss the specifics of our joint effort to take down England. Let's coordinate our moves to put maximum pressure on their northern flank. What do you propose we do next turn to make the most of this opportunity?\n12 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I agree, let's coordinate our moves to put maximum pressure on England's northern flank. How about we simultaneously move our armies into HOL and LVP next turn, while also supporting each other's moves into BEL and GAS?

I'd like to discuss some potential moves that could benefit both our countries. Specifically, I was thinking of moving my army in Northwest to support Sweden, and also moving my fleet in Rum to Black Sea. What are your thoughts on this?\n1 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: Hello Turkey, I appreciate your willingness to discuss potential moves. However, I'm not sure I'm comfortable with your army supporting Sweden, as it could potentially threaten my position in Northwest. How about we discuss a different arrangement? Perhaps we could work together to take down Germany instead? I have a fleet in Sev that could support your army in Rum, and together we could make a strong push into Germany's territory.\n2 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I understand your concerns about Sweden, but I think supporting them could be beneficial for both of us in the long run. However, I'm open to discussing alternative arrangements. Taking down Germany could be a good option, but I'd need to see more specifics about how we could work together to make that happen. What exactly did you have in mind?\n3 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I understand your concerns about supporting Sweden, but I think we can find a way to make it work. How about we agree that you'll support Sweden, and in return, I'll move my fleet in Sev to support your army in Rum? That way, we can both benefit from the arrangement.\n4 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I think that's a good proposal, Russia. Supporting each other in Sweden and Rum could be a strong move. But I'd like to discuss the specifics of how we can work together to take down Germany as well. Can you tell me more about your plan to move into Germany's territory?\n5 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I'm glad we're on the same page, Turkey. To take down Germany, I was thinking we could coordinate a simultaneous attack on their territories. My fleet in Sev could support your army in Rum, and together we could push into Germany's territory. Additionally, I could move my army in Gal to support your army in Bul, and we could take down Germany's army in Sil. What do you think?\n6 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I think that's a solid plan, Russia. With our combined forces, we can put significant pressure on Germany. I'll make sure to move my army in Rum to Black Sea and support your fleet in Sev. Additionally, I'll move my army in Bul to support your army in Gal. Let's make this happen and take down Germany together.\n7 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I'm glad we have an agreement, Turkey. Let's make sure to follow through on our plans and take down Germany together. I'll make sure to move my fleet in Sev to support your army in Rum, and my army in Gal to support your army in Bul. Let's work together to achieve our goals.\n8 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I'm glad we have a clear plan in place, Russia. Let's make sure to follow through and take down Germany together.

By the way, I was thinking of moving my army in War to support your army in Bul as well. What do you think about that?\n10 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: That's a great idea, Russia.

What do you think about a 60-40 split in my favor?\n10 FRANCE -> GERMANY: GERMANY, I understand your point, but I think a 50-50 split is more fair considering our joint efforts.
