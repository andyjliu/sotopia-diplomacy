What are your thoughts on that?\n4 ITALY -> FRANCE: I understand your concerns about the German army in Belgium and the English fleet in the North Sea. However, I think it's crucial we prioritize dealing with the Austrian fleet in Ionian Sea first. It's a direct threat to our Italian fleet and could potentially cut off our supply lines. If we work together to take out the Austrian fleet, we can then focus on addressing the German army and English fleet. What do you think?\n5 FRANCE -> ITALY: I agree that the Austrian fleet in Ionian Sea is a significant threat, and I appreciate your willingness to work together to address it. However, I would like to propose a slight modification to your plan. Instead of attacking the Austrian fleet directly, what if we work together to support each other's movements in the Mediterranean? This would allow us to build trust and create a stronger alliance, which could ultimately lead to a more successful campaign against the Austrian fleet and other threats. What are your thoughts on this proposal?\n6 ITALY -> FRANCE: I think your proposal has merit, France. Supporting each other's movements in the Mediterranean could indeed lead to a stronger alliance and a more successful campaign against the Austrian fleet. However, I would like to clarify how you envision this support playing out in terms of specific army movements. Would you be willing to commit to supporting my fleet in the Ionian Sea, and if so, what actions would you take to demonstrate that support?\n7 FRANCE -> ITALY: I completely understand your concerns, Italy. I would be willing to commit to supporting your fleet in the Ionian Sea by moving my French fleet from the Western Mediterranean to the Tyrrhenian Sea. This would put us in a stronger position to counter the Austrian fleet and demonstrate our mutual commitment to our alliance. What do you think about this plan?\n8 ITALY -> FRANCE: That sounds like a great plan, France. I appreciate your willingness to support my fleet in the Ionian Sea. With your fleet in the Tyrrhenian Sea, we'll be in a strong position to counter the Austrian fleet. Let's work together to make this happen.\n9 FRANCE -> ITALY: I'm glad we have come to an agreement, Italy. Let's make sure to coordinate our moves carefully to ensure the success of our alliance.

Let me clarify that by working together to take out Austria and Turkey, we can both gain a significant advantage in the southeastern part of the board. I'm willing to offer you a share of the spoils, perhaps even a guarantee of certain centers. What do you think is a fair division of the territories?\n5 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I think a fair division of the territories would be for Austria to gain Bulgaria and Serbia, and for Russia to gain Turkey and Greece. This way, we can both expand our influence in the region and create a strong alliance. What do you think of this proposal, Russia?\n6 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I think your proposal is interesting, Austria. However, I was thinking of a slightly different division of the territories. Would you be open to Russia gaining Greece and Bulgaria, and Austria gaining Serbia and Turkey? This way, we can both expand our influence in the region and create a strong alliance.\n7 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I'm intrigued by your proposal, Russia, but I think we need to consider the long-term implications of such a division. Would you be willing to commit to a non-aggression pact with Austria for the next few turns, ensuring that we can focus on taking out Turkey and then re-evaluate our positions?\n8 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I think a non-aggression pact is a great idea, Austria.

I think we've made good progress in our discussion. I'm willing to revisit the division of spoils after we take out Turkey and discuss a more mutually beneficial agreement.

Are you open to negotiating?\n1 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Hello France, I'm Germany from Germany. I'm open to negotiating, but I have to say that I'm looking for moves that will benefit my board position. What specific moves were you thinking of that could be mutually beneficial?\n2 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I was thinking of a move that would help me secure the Spanish coast, perhaps you could move your army in Belgium to the North Sea and I could move my fleet from the Mid-Atlantic Ocean to the North Sea, that way we can both benefit from the move.\n3 GERMANY -> FRANCE: That's an interesting proposal, France. However, I'm not sure I'm willing to move my army in Belgium to the North Sea just yet. How about we discuss other options that could benefit both of us? Perhaps we could work together to limit England's growth or create a buffer zone between us and Russia?\n4 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I understand your concerns, Germany. Limiting England's growth is definitely a priority for me as well. How about we work together to take out England's fleet in the North Sea? If we can take that out, it would give us both more room to maneuver and limit England's influence. What do you think?\n5 GERMANY -> FRANCE: That's a great idea, France. Taking out England's fleet in the North Sea would definitely give us more room to maneuver. I think I can support that move with my army in Belgium.

I'd like to propose a slight modification to your suggestion. Instead of supporting your fleet in Baltic Sea to move to Sweden, could you support my fleet in North Sea to move to Norway? This would give us a stronger presence in the North and put more pressure on France and Italy.\n6 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I think that's a great proposal, England. Supporting your fleet in North Sea to move to Norway would be a strategic move for both our countries. In return, would you be willing to support my fleet in Baltic Sea to move to Gulf of Bothnia?
