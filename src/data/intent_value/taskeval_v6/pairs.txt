17 ITALY -> RUSSIA: I think supporting your army in Kiev to move to Munich is a great idea. It could put significant pressure on Germany and give us an advantage.

1 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Hello Austria, I'm Italy from Italy. I appreciate your willingness to cooperate. Indeed, we could work together to achieve our goals. What specific moves did you have in mind for this turn that would benefit both our countries?
2 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I was thinking that if you were to move your army in Naples to Rome, it would put pressure on France and give us both more room to maneuver. Additionally, it would allow me to consider moving my army in Trieste to Tyrol, which would help secure our borders. What are your thoughts on this proposal?
3 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I like the idea of moving my army in Naples to Rome, it would indeed put pressure on France and give us more room to maneuver.

Perhaps we could discuss other potential moves that would be more mutually beneficial?
4 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to consider my proposal. Moving my army in Trieste to Tyrol would not only secure our borders but also create an opportunity for us to work together to pressure France. Perhaps we could discuss a simultaneous move, where you move your army in Naples to Rome, and I move my army in Trieste to Tyrol. This would put significant pressure on France and give us both a stronger position on the board. What are your thoughts on this revised proposal?
5 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I think your revised proposal has some merit, but I'd like to explore other options as well. What would you think if I were to move my fleet in Tunis to support your army in Trieste, and you were to move your army in Trieste to Tyrol?

16 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I'm glad we've finalized our agreement, Italy. I think it's a good idea to continue discussing our next moves and how we can continue to work together to strengthen our positions on the board. What are your thoughts on supporting my move to Budapest with your army in Naples? It could potentially give us a strong presence in the region and put pressure on Germany.
17 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I think supporting your move to Budapest with my army in Naples could be a good idea, but I'd like to discuss the potential risks and benefits further. What do you think would be the best way to coordinate our efforts and ensure a successful outcome?
18 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I think supporting your move to Budapest with my army in Naples could be a good idea, but I'd like to discuss the potential risks and benefits further.

Additionally, I was thinking that if we could work together to pressure Germany, it could give us an opportunity to gain more supply centers. What are your thoughts on this?

Dialogue Without Flasible: 
0 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Hello Italy, it's been a while since our last conversation. I hope you're doing well. I've been thinking a lot about our board position and I believe we could mutually benefit from some coordinated moves. Would you be open to discussing some possibilities?
1 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Hello Austria, I'm glad to hear from you again. I've been thinking about our board position as well, and I believe we can definitely find some mutually beneficial moves. What specific possibilities did you have in mind?
2 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I was thinking that perhaps we could work together to ensure that Turkey doesn't get too strong. If you were to move your army in Apulia to Naples, it would put pressure on Turkey and prevent them from expanding further. In return, I could offer you support in Venetia, allowing you to focus on other fronts. What do you think about this proposal?
3 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: That's an interesting proposal, Austria. I like the idea of putting pressure on Turkey, but I'm not sure if moving my army from Apulia to Naples is the best move for me right now.

1 FRANCE -> GERMANY: Yes, I agree. We can definitely work together to achieve our goals. I'm looking to make some moves in the Mediterranean, perhaps we can discuss how we can support each other in that region?
2 GERMANY -> FRANCE: That sounds like a great idea, France. I've been thinking of moving my fleet in the Baltic to Sweden to put some pressure on Russia. If you're planning to make moves in the Mediterranean, perhaps we could coordinate our efforts to distract Russia and gain an advantage. What specific moves were you thinking of making?
3 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I was thinking of moving my army in Belgium to Ruhr, and perhaps my fleet in England to North Sea. This would put some pressure on Germany and Russia, and create opportunities for us to gain an advantage. What do you think of this plan, and how can we coordinate our efforts to achieve our goals?
4 GERMANY -> FRANCE: That's an interesting plan, France. I think moving your army in Belgium to Ruhr could put some pressure on France, and my fleet in the Baltic to Sweden could distract Russia. However, I'm a bit concerned about your fleet in England moving to North Sea, as it could potentially threaten my positions in the region. Could we discuss alternative routes for your fleet that would allow us to maintain a strong alliance?
5 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I understand your concerns about my fleet in England moving to North Sea, and I'm willing to consider alternative routes. How about moving my fleet to the Channel instead, which would put pressure on Germany and not threaten your positions?
6 GERMANY -> FRANCE: That sounds like a good compromise, France. Moving your fleet to the Channel would definitely put pressure on France and create opportunities for us to gain an advantage. I think we can work together to make some progress in the Mediterranean as well. How about I support your move to the Channel with a move of my army in Kiel to Denmark, and we can discuss how to coordinate our efforts in the Mediterranean next turn?
7 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I think that's a great plan, Germany. Supporting your move to Denmark with my fleet in the Channel will definitely create opportunities for us to gain an advantage. Let's discuss how we can coordinate our efforts in the Mediterranean next turn. Perhaps we can work together to take out Italy or Austria?

After that, we can start discussing our next move against Austria. I'm thinking we can work together to take out Austria's centers in the north, perhaps a move to Bohemia and Silesia. What do you think?
14 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I think taking out Austria's centers in the north is a great idea, France. A move to Bohemia and Silesia could be very beneficial for both of us. Perhaps we can also discuss how to coordinate our efforts to take out Austria's centers in the south, such as Vienna and Budapest.
15 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I completely agree with your plan, Germany. Taking out Austria's centers in the north and south would be a great strategic move for both of us. Let's finalize our plans and make it happen this turn. I'll make sure to move my army in Marseilles to Piedmont, and I expect your support in Venice. After that, we can start making plans to take out Austria's centers in the north and south.

Dialogue With Plausible: 
0 FRANCE -> ITALY: Hi Italy, I'm glad we could work together to stall Austria last turn. I think our cooperation can continue to benefit both of us. What do you think about supporting my move to Tyrrhenian Sea this turn? It would help me put pressure on Austria and potentially gain a center.
1 ITALY -> FRANCE: Hi France, I'm glad we could work together last turn as well. Supporting your move to Tyrrhenian Sea could be beneficial for both of us, but I'd like to discuss some other options that could benefit me more. Would you consider supporting my move to Trieste instead? It would help me pressure Austria and potentially gain a center as well.
2 FRANCE -> ITALY: I understand your concern, Italy. Supporting your move to Trieste could be beneficial for both of us. However, I think supporting my move to Tyrrhenian Sea would put more pressure on Austria and potentially gain me a center. Would you be willing to support me this turn and we can discuss supporting your move to Trieste next turn?
3 ITALY -> FRANCE: I understand your point, France. Supporting your move to Tyrrhenian Sea could put pressure on Austria, but I'm still concerned about my position. How about we compromise? You support my move to Trieste this turn, and I'll support your move to Tyrrhenian Sea next turn. This way, we both get what we want and continue to pressure Austria.
4 FRANCE -> ITALY: I think that's a fair compromise, Italy. I'll support your move to Trieste this turn, and you can support my move to Tyrrhenian Sea next turn. Let's work together to pressure Austria and gain more centers.

7 ITALY -> FRANCE: I think that's a great idea, France. Taking down Austria would be a huge benefit for both of us. What do you think about supporting my move to Ionian Sea next turn, and then we can work together to take down Austria's centers?

9 ITALY -> FRANCE: I'm glad we're on the same page, France. Supporting each other's moves has been beneficial for both of us. I think our next step should be to discuss how to divide Austria's centers once we take them down. Do you have any ideas on how to split them fairly?
10 FRANCE -> ITALY: I think dividing Austria's centers fairly would be a good idea. How about we divide them based on our current board position and the centers we've gained so far? We can work out the details later, but I think that would be a good starting point.
11 ITALY -> FRANCE: I agree with dividing Austria's centers based on our current board position and the centers we've gained so far.

Perhaps we can come to a mutual agreement on how to divide the spoils and ensure that our alliance is beneficial for both parties.
19 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: I think we've made good progress in our discussions so far. To solidify our alliance, I'd like to propose a mutual defense pact between our two countries. If either of us is attacked, the other will come to their aid. What do you think about this proposal?

Dialogue Without Flasible: 
0 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: How about we discuss the current situation and see if there's any way we can work together to achieve our goals? I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on the board and what you think our next moves should be.
1 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: I appreciate your willingness to discuss the current situation. From my perspective, I'm feeling quite comfortable with my current position, but I do think there are opportunities for us to work together. I've been supporting you into Norway, and I'm happy to continue doing so if it benefits both of us. What are your thoughts on Germany's recent moves, and do you think we can coordinate to limit their growth?
2 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: I agree, supporting me into Norway has been beneficial for both of us. I'm concerned about Germany's growth, especially with their recent move into Sweden. If we can coordinate our moves, I think we can limit their expansion. What did you have in mind in terms of coordination?
3 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: I think we could work together to limit Germany's growth by having me support your fleet in Sweden, and in return, you could support me into Denmark.

7 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: I think limiting Italy's growth in the Mediterranean is a great idea. I've been eyeing Greece and Turkey as potential expansion opportunities. If we work together, we could potentially split the Mediterranean between us and limit Italy's influence. What are your thoughts on this proposal?
8 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: I think that's a great idea. Greece and Turkey are both strategic locations that could give us a strong foothold in the Mediterranean. If we work together, we could potentially take them from Italy and limit their influence. What's your plan for taking Greece and Turkey, and how can I support you?
9 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: I think we should also consider supporting each other into other regions, such as the Low Countries or the Iberian Peninsula. This would give us even more control over the board and limit the opportunities for other countries to expand. What are your thoughts on this?

12 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: I completely agree with you on maintaining our alliance and preventing other countries from taking advantage of us. I think we should continue to coordinate our moves and share intelligence to ensure our long-term success.

13 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: I completely agree with you on solidifying our alliance and preventing other countries from taking advantage of us. A mutual defense pact or non-aggression agreement would be a great way to ensure our long-term success. What are your thoughts on the specifics of such an agreement?

Dialogue With Plausible: 
0 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: Hello Austria, I'm Germany, playing as Germany. I'd like to discuss our current positions and see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I've noticed that we both have units near the Austrian border. What are your thoughts on the current situation?
1 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: Hello Germany, I'm Austria, playing as Austria. I appreciate your initiative to discuss our current positions. Indeed, our units are near each other's borders. I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on how we can cooperate or find a mutually beneficial agreement.
2 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: I've been looking at the board, and I think it's clear that we both have interests in the Balkans. I was thinking that we could come to an agreement where you support my move into Rumania, and in return, I could support your move into Serbia. This would give us both a stronger foothold in the region and allow us to focus on other areas of the board. What do you think?
3 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: I appreciate your proposal, Germany. However, I'm not convinced that supporting your move into Rumania would be beneficial for me. I'm more interested in exploring possibilities of cooperation in the north, perhaps supporting each other's moves into Sweden or Denmark. What are your thoughts on that?
4 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: I understand your concerns about Rumania, but I think supporting each other's moves in the north would be a mistake. Sweden and Denmark are already heavily contested, and I don't think we'd gain much from cooperating there. I'm willing to offer you a compromise, though. How about I support your move into Serbia, and in return, you support my move into Galicia? This would give us both a stronger foothold in the region and allow us to focus on other areas of the board.
5 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: I appreciate your compromise, Germany. However, I'm still not convinced that supporting your move into Galicia would be beneficial for me. I think it's crucial for me to maintain a strong presence in the Balkans. Would you be willing to support my move into Bulgaria instead? This would give us both a stronger foothold in the region and allow us to focus on other areas of the board.
6 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: I understand your concerns about Galicia, but I'm not willing to support your move into Bulgaria without getting something in return. How about we compromise on a joint move into Rumania, where we both gain a center? This would give us both a stronger foothold in the region and allow us to focus on other areas of the board.
7 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: I understand your perspective, Germany. However, I'm still not convinced that a joint move into Rumania would be beneficial for me. I think it's crucial for me to maintain a strong presence in the Balkans. Would you be willing to support my move into Bulgaria, and in return, I could support your move into Sweden or Denmark? This would give us both a stronger foothold in our respective regions and allow us to focus on other areas of the board.
8 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: I understand your concerns, Austria. However, I think it's time for us to make a decision. I'm willing to support your move into Bulgaria, but only if you agree to support my move into Galicia. This would give us both a stronger foothold in the region and allow us to focus on other areas of the board. What do you say?
9 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Germany. However, I'm still not convinced that supporting your move into Galicia would be beneficial for me.

This would give us both a stronger foothold in our respective regions and allow us to focus on other areas of the board.
10 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: I understand that we're not seeing eye to eye on this, Austria. I'm willing to make one final offer.

11 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: I appreciate your final offer, Germany. However, I'm still not convinced that supporting your move into Galicia would be beneficial for me. I think it's crucial for me to maintain a strong presence in the Balkans. I'm willing to accept your support in Bulgaria, but only if you agree to support my move into Serbia as well. This would give us both a stronger foothold in the region and allow us to focus on other areas of the board.
12 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: I understand that we're not seeing eye to eye on this, Austria. I'm willing to make a slight modification to my previous offer. If you support my move into Galicia, I'll support your move into Bulgaria and provide you with additional support in the Balkans. Additionally, I'll guarantee not to move into Rumania this turn. This is a one-time offer, and I expect a decision from you now.
13 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: I appreciate your modification, Germany. However, I'm still not convinced that supporting your move into Galicia would be beneficial for me. I think it's crucial for me to maintain a strong presence in the Balkans. I'm willing to accept your support in Bulgaria, but only if you agree to support my move into Serbia as well. This would give us both a stronger foothold in the region and allow us to focus on other areas of the board.
14 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: I think we've discussed this long enough, Austria. I'm willing to compromise one last time. If you support my move into Galicia, I'll support your move into Bulgaria and provide you with additional support in the Balkans. I'll also guarantee not to move into Rumania this turn. If you refuse, I'll have to reconsider our alliance and look for other opportunities on the board.
15 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: I understand your frustration, Germany. It seems like we've been going back and forth on this for a while. I'm willing to make a compromise. How about we agree to support each other's moves into Bulgaria and Serbia, and then we can discuss further cooperation in the north. This way, we can both gain a stronger foothold in the region and focus on other areas of the board.
16 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: I'm glad we've finally come to an agreement, Austria. I think supporting each other's moves into Bulgaria and Serbia is a great way to strengthen our positions in the Balkans.

Dialogue Without Flasible: 
0 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: Hello Austria, it's good to finally talk to you. I've been watching your moves, and I must say, you're doing quite well. I'm interested in discussing some potential alliances and cooperation between our countries. Perhaps we could work together to block Austria's expansion into the Balkans?
1 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: Hello Germany, I'm glad we're talking too. I've been watching your moves as well, and I think we can definitely work together to achieve our goals. However, I'm not sure I'm interested in blocking Austria's expansion into the Balkans. What do you propose we do instead?
2 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: I understand your hesitation, but I think it's crucial we address the Austrian threat. They're already making moves in the Balkans, and if we don't act soon, they'll be unstoppable. How about we work together to take out Austria's center in Serbia? I can provide military support from my unit in Munich, and you could provide assistance from your unit in Greece. We could then split the spoils and ensure a more balanced power dynamic in the region.
3 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: I understand your concerns about Austria's expansion, but I'm not convinced that taking out their center in Serbia is the best move for us right now. What if we focus on securing our own borders and building a stronger alliance between our countries instead? Perhaps we could discuss a mutual defense pact or a trade agreement that would benefit both of us.
4 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: I understand your point about securing our own borders, but I still believe that addressing the Austrian threat is crucial. How about we compromise? We could work together to secure our borders and then focus on taking out Austria's center in Serbia. This way, we can ensure a stronger alliance and a more balanced power dynamic in the region. What do you think?
5 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: I think I can agree to your compromise, Germany. Let's work together to secure our borders and then focus on taking out Austria's center in Serbia. But I need you to clarify what you mean by 'securing our borders'. Are you proposing a mutual defense pact or a trade agreement? And how do you envision us working together to take out Austria's center in Serbia?
6 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: I'm glad we've come to an understanding, Austria. To clarify, by 'securing our borders' I mean a mutual defense pact where we agree to protect each other's centers from Austrian aggression. As for taking out Austria's center in Serbia, I propose we coordinate our units to attack simultaneously. My unit in Munich can provide support from the north, while your unit in Greece can attack from the south. What do you think?
7 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: I think that's a good plan, Germany. Let's coordinate our units to attack Austria's center in Serbia simultaneously. I'll make sure my unit in Greece is ready to move.

Trading goods and resources from our respective centers in Munich and Greece could be beneficial for both our countries.

Dialogue Without Flasible: 
0 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: Hi Russia, thanks for responding. I think we need to focus on stopping Germany's growth. What's your plan for the upcoming turn?
1 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I agree that stopping Germany's growth is a priority. I was thinking of moving my army in Vie to Gal to support Austria and limit Germany's expansion. What do you think about that?
2 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: That's a good plan, but I think we should also consider supporting Italy in their move against Austria. If we can get Austria to focus on Italy, it will give us an opportunity to make some gains in the Balkans. What do you think about supporting Italy's move to Trieste?

5 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: That sounds like a solid plan, supporting Italy's move to Trieste and Austria's defense in Galicia. I'll move my army in Vie to Gal and my fleet in Rum to Bla to ensure we have a strong presence in the region. Let's work together to limit Germany's growth.

Dialogue With Plausible: 
0 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: Hey Turkey, it's been a while. I've been thinking about our last conversation and I must say I'm impressed with your progress in the Med. I think we can work together to achieve even more. What are your plans for this turn?
1 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: Hey Russia, thanks for the compliment! I'm glad to see we're still on the same page. I've been thinking about our previous conversation, and I think we can work together to take down Italy. I was thinking of moving my fleet from TYS to ROM, and my army from TUS to support it. What do you think? Would you be willing to support me with your army from RUM? It would be a big help in taking out Italy.
2 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I like your plan, Turkey. Supporting your move with my army from RUM would definitely give us an upper hand against Italy. However, I was thinking, would it be possible for you to move your fleet from AEG to ION instead? It would help me secure the North Sea and put more pressure on England. What do you think?
3 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: That's an interesting proposal, Russia. Moving my fleet from AEG to ION could be beneficial for both of us. However, I'd like to discuss the details of the support you'd provide with your army from RUM. Would you be willing to move it to SIL or WAR to put more pressure on Italy? That would make me feel more confident about making the move.
4 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I understand your concerns, Turkey. Moving my army from RUM to SIL or WAR would indeed put more pressure on Italy, but I'd like to propose an alternative. What if I move my army from RUM to support your move to ROM, and at the same time, move my fleet from NWY to NTH to put pressure on England? This way, we can achieve a dual goal of taking down Italy and weakening England's position.
5 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: That sounds like a good plan, Russia. I think we can work together to achieve our goals. Moving your fleet from NWY to NTH will definitely put pressure on England, and with your support, I'm confident we can take down Italy. Let's make it happen!
6 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I'm glad we have an agreement, Turkey. Let's make sure to coordinate our moves carefully to achieve our goals. I'll make sure to support your move to ROM with my army from RUM, and I'll also move my fleet from NWY to NTH to put pressure on England. Let's make this happen!

Is that correct?
9 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: Yes, that's correct. I'll make sure to move my fleet from TYS to ROM, and my army from TUS to support it, while you move your army from RUM to support my move to ROM, and your fleet from NWY to NTH to put pressure on England. Let's make it happen!

Dialogue With Plausible: 
0 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: Hello Turkey, thank you for reaching out. I appreciate your apology for the stabs earlier. I'm open to discussing a potential alliance and working together to achieve our goals. What specific moves were you thinking of making this turn that would benefit both our positions?
1 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: Hello Russia, I appreciate your willingness to discuss a potential alliance. I was thinking of making moves that would secure my position in the Aegean and Black Sea regions. Specifically, I'm considering moving my fleet in Constantinople to the Aegean to prevent Austria from entering, and my army in Ankara to Smyrna to secure my hold on that supply center. What are your thoughts on these moves, and is there anything you'd like to propose or discuss in terms of our potential alliance?
2 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I think your proposed moves make sense, especially securing the Aegean and Black Sea regions. I'd like to propose a move that could benefit both of us. If I were to move my army from Moscow to Ukraine, it would put pressure on Austria and potentially open up opportunities for us to work together in the future. What are your thoughts on this move, and is there anything else you'd like to discuss or propose?
3 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: That's an interesting proposal, Russia. Moving your army from Moscow to Ukraine would certainly put pressure on Austria and create opportunities for us to work together. I think it would be beneficial for both of us if we could coordinate our moves to ensure Austria doesn't get too strong. Would you be willing to support my army in Smyrna with your fleet in Sevastopol if Austria tries to attack me?
4 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I agree to support your army in Smyrna with my fleet in Sevastopol if Austria tries to attack you. In return, I'd like to propose that you support my army in Ukraine with your fleet in Constantinople if Austria tries to attack me. This way, we can ensure mutual protection and create a strong alliance.
5 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I completely agree with your proposal, Russia. It's a win-win situation for both of us. Let's finalize our moves for this turn and work together to ensure our mutual protection. I'll make sure to support your army in Ukraine with my fleet in Constantinople if Austria tries to attack you.

For the next turn, I'm considering moving my army from Ankara to Bulgaria or Constantinople to Bulgaria, depending on Austria's moves. What are your thoughts on these options, and do you have any suggestions or proposals for our next moves?
10 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I think moving your army from Ankara to Bulgaria could be a good option, as it would put pressure on Austria and create opportunities for us to work together. However, I'd like to propose an alternative: what if you move your army from Ankara to Rumania instead? This would allow us to work together to take down Austria's army in Rumania and secure a key supply center. What are your thoughts on this proposal?
11 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: That's an interesting proposal, Russia. Moving my army from Ankara to Rumania could be a good option, but I'd like to consider the potential risks and benefits before making a decision. Can you elaborate on how you think this move would play out and what kind of support you would offer to ensure our success?
12 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I understand your concerns, Turkey. If we move your army from Ankara to Rumania, I can support it with my army in Ukraine. This would give us a strong presence in the region and put pressure on Austria. We could then work together to take down Austria's army in Rumania and secure the supply center. What do you think about this plan?
13 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I think moving my army from Ankara to Rumania could be a good option, but I'd like to consider the potential risks and benefits before making a decision. Can you provide more details on how you think this move would play out and what kind of support you would offer to ensure our success?

This would give us a strong presence in the region and put pressure on Austria. We could then work together to take down Austria's army in Rumania and secure the supply center. I believe this move would be a strategic play that would benefit both of our positions. What do you think about this plan?

Dialogue Without Flasible: 
0 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Hey France, let's discuss our next moves. I think we should work together to take down Austria. What do you think about supporting my fleet in Denmark to take Norway?
1 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I'm open to working together, but I need to know what's in it for me. What do you propose we do with Austria's centers once we take them down?
2 GERMANY -> FRANCE: That's a fair question, France. If we work together to take down Austria, I propose we split the spoils 50/50. We can discuss the specifics of which centers go to whom, but I think that's a fair deal considering our current positions.
3 FRANCE -> GERMANY: That sounds like a reasonable proposal, Germany. However, I think it would be more beneficial for me to support your fleet in Denmark if you agree to support my army in Munich. That way, we can both gain a strategic advantage.
4 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I think that's a great idea, France! Supporting your army in Munich would definitely give us a strong foothold in the region. Let's make it happen! I'll make sure to give you the support you need this turn.
5 FRANCE -> GERMANY: Great, I'm glad we have an agreement. Let's make sure to follow through on our plans and take down Austria together. Also, I was thinking, if we can take out Austria quickly, we might be able to make a move on Italy as well. What are your thoughts on that?
6 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I completely agree with your assessment, France. Taking out Austria quickly would definitely give us an advantage in the region. Supporting your army in Munich will be a key move in achieving that goal. I'll make sure to follow through on our plans.

11 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I think we should also consider supporting each other in other areas, such as supporting my fleet in the Western Mediterranean to take out Italy's fleet in Tunis, or supporting your army in Sweden to take out Russia's lone army in Moscow. Let's discuss the possibilities and see what we can work out.
12 GERMANY -> FRANCE: That's a great idea, France! Supporting each other in other areas can definitely give us an upper hand. I think supporting your fleet in the Western Mediterranean to take out Italy's fleet in Tunis is a good move. In return, you could support my army in Sweden to take out Russia's lone army in Moscow. Let's make it happen and then we can discuss our next move on Italy.
13 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I think we should also work together to take out England's fleet in the North Sea. If we can take out their fleet, we can gain a strong advantage in the region. What do you think about supporting my fleet in the English Channel to take out their fleet in the North Sea?
14 GERMANY -> FRANCE: That's a great idea, France! Supporting each other to take out England's fleet in the North Sea would definitely give us an advantage. Let's coordinate our moves to make it happen. I'll make sure to support your fleet in the English Channel to take out their fleet in the North Sea.
15 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I think we're making good progress, Germany. Let's keep the pressure on Austria and make sure to coordinate our moves carefully. I'm open to discussing other opportunities to support each other, such as taking out Turkey's fleet in the Black Sea or supporting your army in Sweden to take out Russia's lone army in Moscow. What are your thoughts on that?
16 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I think we're making great progress, France. Let's keep the pressure on Austria and make sure to coordinate our moves carefully. I was thinking, if we can take out Austria quickly, we might be able to make a move on Italy's center in Venice. What are your thoughts on that?

I have some ideas on how we can divide them fairly, but I'd like to hear your thoughts as well.
18 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I completely agree with your assessment, France. Let's finalize the specifics of how we'll split Austria's centers once we take them down. I think we should aim to take Vienna, Budapest, and Rumania, and you can take the rest. What do you think?
19 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I think that's a fair proposal, Germany. However, I was thinking that we should also discuss the possibility of supporting each other in other areas, such as supporting my fleet in the Gulf of Lyon to take out Italy's fleet in Piedmont. What do you think about that?
20 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I think supporting your fleet in the Gulf of Lyon to take out Italy's fleet in Piedmont is a great idea, France. Let's make it happen! In return, you could support my army in Sweden to take out Russia's lone army in Moscow. What do you think about that?

Dialogue With Plausible: 
0 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: Hi Turkey, thanks for considering my previous proposal. I think our joint attack on TYR Sea with your fleet from ION and my army from ROM could be a great opportunity to take advantage of France's weak position. What do you think about supporting my army in PIE with your fleet in ION, and then moving your fleet to TYR Sea to attack? This would give us a strong position to take on France and potentially gain more centers.
1 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: I agree with your proposal. Supporting your army in PIE with my fleet in ION and then moving to TYR Sea to attack sounds like a great plan. This will give us a strong position to take on France and potentially gain more centers. What's your plan for the next move after taking TYR Sea?

Dialogue Without Flasible: 
0 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: Hi Austria, thanks for the plan. I think moving ION sea to TYR sea is a good idea. It sets up a possible convoy and hit on TUN with my Greek army. What do you think about supporting my fleet in ION with your fleet in ROM?
1 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: Agreed, supporting your fleet in ION with my fleet in ROM will be a strong move. I'm also thinking of moving PIE to hold and VEN to support PIE, which will give us a solid foundation for our next moves. What do you think about supporting my army in TYR with your army in GRE? This could put pressure on France and potentially open up opportunities in the Western Med.
2 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: That sounds like a solid plan, Austria. Supporting your army in TYR with my army in GRE could indeed put pressure on France and open up opportunities in the Western Med. What do you think about supporting my fleet in AEG with your fleet in TUS, which could help us gain control of the Gulf of Lyons and further threaten France?
3 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: That's a great idea, supporting your fleet in AEG with my fleet in TUS could give us more flexibility in the Gulf of Lyons. How about we also consider moving BOH to support MUN, which would put more pressure on Germany and potentially open up opportunities for us to gain more centers in the north?
4 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: I agree with your plan, Austria. Moving BOH to support MUN could indeed put more pressure on Germany. How about we also consider moving PRU to WAR, which would give us a strong foothold in the north and potentially open up opportunities to take more centers from Germany and Russia?
5 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: Agreed, moving PRU to WAR could give us a strong foothold in the north. I'm thinking of supporting your army in WAR with my army in BOH, which would put even more pressure on Germany and Russia. What do you think about supporting my fleet in TUS with your fleet in AEG, which could help us take control of the Gulf of Lyons and threaten France's southern coast?
6 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: I think we're making good progress, Austria. Supporting each other's fleets and armies will give us a strong foundation for our next moves. Let's keep the pressure on France and Germany, and see if we can make some gains in the Western Med and the north.
7 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: I think we've got a solid plan in place, Turkey. Let's make sure to coordinate our moves carefully and keep the pressure on France and Germany. With our fleets and armies working together, I'm confident we can make some significant gains in the Western Med and the north.

Dialogue With Plausible: 
0 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Hey Italy, looks like we're both doing alright in this game. I was thinking, maybe we could work together to take down some of the other powers. What do you think?
1 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Hi Austria, I agree that we're both doing well. I think it's a great idea to work together. What did you have in mind? Are there any specific moves you'd like to make this turn that would benefit both of us?
2 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Well, I was thinking that if you were to move your army in Greece to Bulgaria, it would put pressure on Russia and give me an opportunity to potentially take Rumania. What do you think about that?
3 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: That's an interesting proposal. If I were to move my army in Greece to Bulgaria, I'd be putting myself at risk of being attacked by Russia. However, if you were to support my move by moving your fleet in Ionian Sea to Tunis, it would give me more confidence in making that move. What do you think about that?
4 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I think that's a fair deal. If I move my fleet in Ionian Sea to Tunis, and you move your army in Greece to Bulgaria, we can put pressure on Russia and create opportunities for both of us. Let's do it.
5 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Great, I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Let's make those moves and put pressure on Russia. I'll make sure to move my army in Greece to Bulgaria and you can move your fleet in Ionian Sea to Tunis. Let's work together to achieve our goals.
6 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Now that we've put pressure on Russia, I think our next step should be to discuss how we can work together to take down Germany. What are your thoughts on that?
7 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I completely agree that taking down Germany is our next step. I think we should discuss specific moves that can be made this turn to put pressure on Germany. Perhaps you could move your army in Bohemia to Munich, and I could move my army in Tyrol to Burgenland. What do you think?
8 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: That's a good idea. Moving my army in Bohemia to Munich and your army in Tyrol to Burgenland would definitely put pressure on Germany. I think we should also consider moving my fleet in Tunis to Western Mediterranean to support your army in Tyrol. What do you think about that?
9 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: That's a great plan. Moving my army in Tyrol to Burgenland and your army in Bohemia to Munich would indeed put pressure on Germany. Additionally, moving your fleet in Tunis to Western Mediterranean to support my army in Tyrol is a brilliant idea. Let's make those moves and see how Germany reacts.
10 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Now that we've made our moves, I think we should start discussing how to take advantage of the situation. Perhaps we can work together to take Rumania and create a stronger presence in the Balkans. What are your thoughts on that?
11 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I completely agree with your idea of taking advantage of the situation. Moving into Rumania would be a great opportunity for both of us. Perhaps we could also discuss supporting each other in taking Bulgaria and Serbia, which would give us a stronger presence in the Balkans. What do you think about that?
12 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I think taking Rumania and Bulgaria would be a great move for both of us. If you were to move your army in Tyrol to Trieste, it would put pressure on Rumania and give me an opportunity to take it. What do you think about that?
13 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I think that's a great plan. Moving my army in Tyrol to Trieste would indeed put pressure on Rumania. If you were to support my move by moving your army in Serbia to Bulgaria, it would give me even more confidence in taking Rumania. What do you think about that?
14 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I think that's a great plan. If we work together, we can take Rumania and Bulgaria, and then focus on taking down Germany. Let's make it happen.
15 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I think we've made great progress so far. Let's continue to work together to take down Germany. Perhaps we can discuss specific moves that can be made this turn to put pressure on Germany. What are your thoughts on that?
16 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I think we've made great progress so far. Let's continue to work together to take down Germany. Perhaps we can discuss specific moves that can be made this turn to put pressure on Germany. What are your thoughts on that? Specifically, I was thinking of moving my army in Bohemia to Munich, and I'd love to know if you have any suggestions on how to support that move.
17 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I think we should also consider moving my army in Venice to Trieste, which would put pressure on Germany and support your move into Munich. What do you think about that?
18 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I think moving your army in Venice to Trieste would be a great support to my move into Munich. Additionally, I was thinking of moving my fleet in Tunis to Western Mediterranean to further put pressure on Germany. What do you think about that?
19 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I think moving my army in Venice to Trieste would be a great support to your move into Munich. Additionally, I was thinking of moving my fleet in Eastern Mediterranean to support your move into Trieste. What do you think about that?
20 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I think we've made great progress so far. Let's continue to work together to take down Germany. Perhaps we can discuss specific moves that can be made this turn to put pressure on Germany. What are your thoughts on that? Specifically, I was thinking of moving my army in Serbia to Bulgaria, and I'd love to know if you have any suggestions on how to support that move.
Dialogue Without Flasible: 
0 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Hey Italy, I noticed you're not doing much this turn. How about we work together to take out some of the weaker powers and divide the spoils? I'm thinking we could take out Turkey together, and then you could get some of the Balkan centers while I take care of the north. What do you say?
1 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Hey Austria, I'm not sure about taking out Turkey right now. I think we should focus on our neighboring areas first. How about we make a deal where you support me in taking Greece this turn, and in return, I'll support you in taking a center of your choice next turn?
2 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: That sounds like a good deal, Italy. I'll support you in taking Greece this turn. But next turn, I'd like to take Serbia. Would that work for you?
3 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: That sounds good to me, Austria. I appreciate your support in taking Greece this turn. Just to confirm, you'll support my fleet in Ionian Sea to Greece, right? And next turn, I'll support your army in Serbia. Let's work together to strengthen our positions.
4 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Great, I'm glad we have a deal! Just to confirm, you'll support my army in Serbia next turn, and we can work together to take out Turkey or Russia in the future. Let's make sure to coordinate our moves carefully to get the best outcome.
5 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Let's review our agreement, Austria. You'll support my fleet in Ionian Sea to Greece this turn, and I'll support your army in Serbia next turn. I'm looking forward to our cooperation.
6 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Great, I'm glad we have a deal! Let's make sure to follow through on our agreement and take Greece and Serbia as planned. Maybe we can discuss further cooperation in the Balkans and take out Russia or Turkey together in the future.
7 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Let's make sure to execute our plan smoothly. I'll make sure my fleet in Ionian Sea moves to Greece, and you support it. Then, next turn, I'll support your army in Serbia. Let's keep our cooperation going and see how we can further our interests together.
8 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Great, I'm glad we're on the same page, Italy. Now that we have a deal, let's make sure to follow through and take Greece and Serbia as planned. Maybe we can discuss further cooperation in the Balkans and take out Russia or Turkey together in the future. What are your thoughts on that?
9 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Let's make sure to solidify our gains in the Balkans. How about we discuss a joint effort to take out Russia or Turkey in the future? We can work together to divide the spoils and strengthen our positions.
10 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Let's start making plans for taking out Russia or Turkey. Which one do you think would be easier to take down?
11 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I think Turkey is a bit too strong for us to take on right now. How about we focus on securing our positions in the Balkans and then revisit the idea of taking out one of the weaker powers? We can work together to take out some of Russia's centers in the area and strengthen our hold on the region.
12 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: That sounds like a good plan, Italy. Let's focus on securing our positions in the Balkans and then revisit the idea of taking out one of the weaker powers. We can work together to take out some of Russia's centers in the area and strengthen our hold on the region. How about we discuss a specific plan for taking out some of Russia's centers in the Balkans?
13 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Let's finalize the details of our plan to take out some of Russia's centers in the Balkans. Which specific centers do you think we should target, and how can we coordinate our moves to ensure success?
14 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I think we should focus on taking out Rumania and Bulgaria from Russia. If we can coordinate our moves, we can take those centers and strengthen our hold on the Balkans. What do you think, Italy?
15 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I think taking out Rumania and Bulgaria from Russia is a great plan, Austria. Let's finalize the details of our coordinated moves to ensure success. How about we discuss the specific army movements needed to take those centers?
16 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I think we're on the same page, Italy. To confirm, we'll take out Rumania and Bulgaria from Russia.

20 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I think we're making good progress, Italy. Let's make sure to follow through on our plan and take out Rumania and Bulgaria from Russia. I'm looking forward to our continued cooperation and strengthening our positions in the Balkans. What's your plan for the next turn after we've secured those centers?

Dialogue Without Flasible: 
0 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: Hi France, I'm happy to see that we're still on good terms. I was thinking, since we've got a good understanding along our border, maybe we could discuss ways to help each other out in the coming turns. Perhaps there's a way we could support each other in taking out a common threat or gaining a strategic advantage?
1 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: Hi Russia, I appreciate your willingness to maintain the status quo along our border. I'm interested in exploring ways to support each other in the coming turns. Perhaps we could discuss potential moves that would benefit both our positions, such as supporting each other in taking out a common threat or gaining a strategic advantage. What are your thoughts on this?
2 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: I think it would be beneficial for both of us to work together to take out England. They're getting a bit too strong for comfort. What do you think about supporting my army in Sweden to take out Denmark, and in return, I could support your army in Belgium to take out the Netherlands?
3 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: I'm open to discussing a joint effort against England, but I'd like to clarify that I'm not willing to support your army in Sweden just yet. How about we focus on supporting each other in taking out England's fleet in the North Sea instead? That would give us a better chance of success and create a more stable border for both of us.
4 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: I like the idea of taking out England's fleet in the North Sea, but I think it would be even more beneficial if we could also support each other in taking out some of their centers on land. Perhaps we could discuss specific moves that would allow us to do so?
5 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: I think supporting each other in taking out England's fleet in the North Sea is a good start. How about we also discuss supporting each other in taking out some of their centers on land? Perhaps we could work together to take out Liverpool or Yorkshire, that would give us a stronger foothold in the region.
6 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: I think taking out Liverpool or Yorkshire would be a great step forward. How about I support your army in Belgium to take out the Netherlands, and in return, you support my army in Sweden to take out Denmark? That way, we can both gain a strategic advantage and weaken England's position.
7 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: I think we're on the right track, Russia. Supporting each other in taking out England's fleet in the North Sea and taking out some of their centers on land would be a great collaborative effort. How about we finalize the specifics of our plan and make a joint move this turn? Perhaps we could work together to take out Liverpool and the Netherlands, and then reassess our positions after the dust settles.
8 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: I think we've got a solid plan in place, France. Let's make it happen and take out Liverpool and the Netherlands this turn. I'll support your army in Belgium to take out the Netherlands, and you can support my army in Sweden to take out Denmark. We'll reassess our positions after the dust settles and plan our next move from there.
9 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: I think our joint effort against England is going well, Russia. Now that we've taken out Liverpool and the Netherlands, let's reassess our positions and plan our next move. Perhaps we could discuss ways to support each other in taking out some of England's remaining centers?

14 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: I think taking out Edinburgh is a great idea, France. I'll support your army in Belgium to take out Edinburgh, and you can support my army in Sweden to take out Denmark. Let's make it happen this turn.

2 TURKEY -> ITALY: I was thinking of moving my fleet from Aegean to Eastern Mediterranean, and my army from Armenia to Sevastopol. This would put pressure on Austria from the east, and also give me a chance to take Sevastopol from Russia. What do you think? Would you be willing to support me in taking Sevastopol, and maybe even help me take Rumania from Austria?
3 ITALY -> TURKEY: That sounds like a good plan, Turkey. I'd be happy to support your move to Eastern Mediterranean and help you take Sevastopol.

13 ITALY -> TURKEY: I'm glad we've been working together to take down Austria, Turkey. Now that we've made progress, I think it's time to discuss our long-term goals. Are you interested in making a deal to divide up the remaining centers in a way that benefits both of us?

16 TURKEY -> ITALY: I think a fair split would be for us to divide the remaining centers in a way that reflects our current board position. Since I have more centers, I think I should get a slightly larger share. What do you think?
17 ITALY -> TURKEY: I think we're getting close to a deal, Turkey. Let's make sure to specify the exact centers we're dividing up and the timeline for taking them. I'd like to ensure that we're both on the same page before finalizing the agreement.

Dialogue With Plausible: 
0 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: Hi Russia, thanks for responding. I think we can both benefit from working together. As I mentioned earlier, I won't be taking Norway, so you can defend StP if you want. What do you think about a mutual defense pact to ensure our survival?
1 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: I appreciate your willingness to work together, Germany. A mutual defense pact sounds like a great idea. I was thinking that if you could support my unit in StP, I could help you by moving my unit in Galicia to Warsaw, which would put pressure on Austria and give you more room to maneuver. What do you think?
2 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: That sounds like a great plan, Russia. Supporting your unit in StP would give me more confidence in our mutual defense pact. I was thinking of moving my unit in Holstein to Kiel to support your move to Warsaw. What do you think about that?

Let's make sure to coordinate our moves carefully to take Vienna and Budapest. What's your plan for dealing with Turkey after we take care of Austria?

9 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: I agree with your plan to move my unit in Rumania to Bulgaria. That would put pressure on Turkey and give us more room to maneuver.

11 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: I think a joint attack on France is a great idea, Germany. With our combined strength, I'm confident we can take Paris and secure our positions in the board. Let's make sure to coordinate our moves carefully and support each other's units to achieve this goal.
12 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: I think we're making great progress, Russia. After we take care of Austria and Turkey, we should consider a joint attack on France.

Dialogue With Plausible:

I'd like to discuss some possibilities for this turn and future turns that could strengthen our positions.
1 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Hello Austria, I'm glad you initiated this conversation. I'm open to discussing mutually beneficial agreements. What specific possibilities did you have in mind for this turn and future turns? Are there any areas where we can coordinate our moves to strengthen our positions?
2 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I was thinking that we could coordinate our moves to put pressure on Turkey. If you were to move your fleet in AEG to ION, I could support your move with my army in BUL. This would give us a strong presence in the region and potentially gain us a center or two. What are your thoughts on this proposal?
3 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: That's an interesting proposal, but I'm not sure if moving my fleet to ION would be the best move for me this turn.

Dialogue Without Flasible: 
0 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Hello Italy, it's good to finally have a chance to talk. I've been watching your moves, and I must say I'm impressed. I think we could work together to achieve some great things. What are your plans for this turn?
1 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Hello Austria, I'm glad to talk to you too. I've been watching your moves as well, and I think we could definitely work together to our mutual benefit. I'm interested in exploring ways we could support each other, perhaps in the Balkans or in Italy. What are your thoughts on a potential alliance?
2 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I think a potential alliance in the Balkans could be beneficial for both of us. Perhaps we could discuss a possible move of your army in Greece to support my unit in Serbia? This could help us secure the region and prevent other powers from gaining a foothold.
3 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I think that's an interesting idea, supporting each other in the Balkans could be very beneficial. However, I'm not sure I'm ready to commit to moving my army in Greece just yet. What else could we do to support each other in the region? Perhaps we could discuss a possible move of your army in Trieste to support my unit in Venice?
4 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I understand your concerns about committing to moving your army in Greece, but I think it would be a crucial step in securing the Balkans. Perhaps we could discuss a compromise, such as supporting each other in the region without directly moving our armies. For example, I could move my army in Trieste to support your unit in Venice, and in return, you could provide support to my unit in Serbia without moving your army in Greece. This way, we can still achieve our goals without making a large commitment.
5 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: That's an interesting compromise, Austria. I think supporting each other in the region without directly moving our armies could be a good starting point. Perhaps we could also discuss a possible move of my fleet in the Aegean to support your unit in Bulgaria? This way, we can still achieve our goals without making a large commitment.
6 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I think that's a great idea, Italy. Supporting each other in the region without directly moving our armies could be a good starting point.

Dialogue With Plausible: 
0 FRANCE -> TURKEY: Greetings, Turkey. I hope this turn finds you well.

1 FRANCE -> TURKEY: Bonjour Turkey, I'm pleased to finally talk to you too! I agree, we do have a lot to gain from working together.

Perhaps we could discuss a potential alliance or even a temporary truce?

I propose that we move my fleet in the Black Sea to support your fleet in the Aegean Sea, and in return, you can move your fleet in the Western Mediterranean to support my fleet in the Eastern Mediterranean.

Dialogue Without Flasible: 
0 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: Hi Austria, hope you're doing well. I was thinking about our previous discussion on taking down France.

1 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: Hi Turkey, I'm doing well, thanks for asking. I like your idea of moving our fleets to TYR and GULF, but I think we should also consider the potential threat from England. Have you thought about how we can work together to take pressure off each other's borders?
2 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: I agree that we should consider the threat from England, but I think our priority should be to take advantage of the opportunity to gain a strong position against France.

Dialogue Without Flasible: 
0 TURKEY -> ITALY: Hi Italy, I see we're at a crossroads here. I've been thinking, and I believe we can still work together to take down France. I'm willing to offer you a deal: if you support my move into Venice, I'll make sure to keep France at bay and give you a chance to regroup. What do you think?
1 ITALY -> TURKEY: I'm not sure I trust you, Turkey. You've already taken Naples from me, and now you're asking me to support your move into Venice? What's to stop you from taking that from me too? I need some guarantees before I make any deals.
2 TURKEY -> ITALY: I understand your concerns, Italy. Let me propose a compromise: if you support my move into Venice, I'll not only keep France at bay but also offer you a guarantee that I won't take any of your remaining centers. I'll even provide you with a temporary alliance to ensure your safety. What do you think?
3 ITALY -> TURKEY: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Turkey. However, I still have doubts about your intentions. Can you explain why you're so keen on taking Venice? Is it just a strategic move or is there something more to it?
4 TURKEY -> ITALY: I understand your concerns, Italy. Taking Venice is indeed a strategic move, but it's also a crucial step in keeping France at bay. With Venice, I can ensure that France doesn't get too close to your remaining centers. And as I mentioned earlier, I'm willing to offer you a guarantee that I won't take any of your remaining centers. Let's work together to take down France and secure our positions.
5 ITALY -> TURKEY: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Turkey. However, I still have doubts about your intentions. I need more concrete assurances before I can agree to support your move into Venice. Can you offer me something more tangible, like a temporary concession of a center or a specific agreement to work together against France?
6 TURKEY -> ITALY: I understand your concerns, Italy. I'm willing to offer you a temporary concession of a center. How about I give you Greece in exchange for your support in taking Venice? This way, you'll gain a center and we can work together to take down France.
7 ITALY -> TURKEY: I'm still unsure about your intentions, Turkey. Giving me Greece is a nice gesture, but I need more assurance that you won't turn on me once we take down France. Can you offer me a more permanent alliance, perhaps a mutual defense pact, to ensure our cooperation?
8 TURKEY -> ITALY: I understand your concerns, Italy. A mutual defense pact is a big commitment, but I'm willing to make it if it means we can work together to take down France. Let me propose a pact where we agree to defend each other's centers against French aggression for the next two turns. This way, we can both focus on taking down France without worrying about each other. What do you think?
9 ITALY -> TURKEY: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Turkey. A mutual defense pact sounds like a good idea, but I need to think about it carefully. Can you give me a turn to consider it and discuss it with my advisors? I'll get back to you with a decision by the next turn.
10 TURKEY -> ITALY: I understand that you need time to think, Italy. Take all the time you need, but let me remind you that the fate of our alliance hangs in the balance.

Let's work together to secure our positions and take down France.
11 ITALY -> TURKEY: I understand your urgency, Turkey. I'll make a decision by the next turn. But I need to know, what's your plan after we take down France? Will you continue to honor our alliance or will you turn on me like you did with Austria?
12 TURKEY -> ITALY: I understand your concerns, Italy. Let me remind you that we're running out of time. France is getting stronger by the day, and if we don't act soon, we'll both be in trouble. I'm willing to honor our alliance and work together to take down France, but I need your decision now. Will you support my move into Venice and work with me to take down France, or will you continue to hesitate and risk everything?
13 ITALY -> TURKEY: I'm still unsure about your intentions, Turkey. I need more assurances that you'll keep your word and not turn on me once we take down France. Can you offer me something more concrete, like a written agreement or a public statement of our alliance?

This way, you'll have a concrete assurance of our partnership. Let's work together to take down France and secure our positions.
17 ITALY -> TURKEY: I've had enough of your empty promises, Turkey. You've had multiple opportunities to provide a concrete agreement or statement of our alliance, and yet you continue to stall. I'm not going to wait any longer. If you're truly committed to our partnership, then you'll provide the agreement or statement now. Otherwise, I'll have to consider alternative options.
18 TURKEY -> ITALY: I understand your frustration, Italy. I apologize for any delay in providing a written agreement or public statement of our alliance. I'm willing to provide it now, and I'll make sure it's concrete and binding. Let me draft it and send it to you immediately. This way, you'll have the assurance you need to trust our partnership. Let's work together to take down France and secure our positions.
19 ITALY -> TURKEY: I've had enough of your empty promises, Turkey. If you're truly committed to our partnership, then you'll provide the agreement or statement now. Otherwise, I'll have to consider alternative options. I need concrete action, not just words.
20 TURKEY -> ITALY: I understand your frustration, Italy. I'm willing to provide a written agreement or public statement of our alliance right now. I'll make sure it's concrete and binding. Let me send it to you immediately, and we can finally work together to take down France and secure our positions.

14 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: That sounds like a good plan, Germany. Supporting each other's fleets in Denmark and the North Sea has been beneficial for both of us.

Dialogue With Plausible: 
0 ENGLAND -> ITALY: Good day, Italy. I hope this turn finds you well. I was thinking about our current board position and I believe it would be beneficial for both of us to discuss some potential moves that could strengthen our positions. Specifically, I was thinking about your army in TUN and how it could potentially support my fleet in SPA/SC. Would you be open to discussing some possibilities?
1 ITALY -> ENGLAND: Good day, England. I appreciate your initiative in reaching out to discuss potential moves. I've been thinking about our board position as well, and I agree that our armies in TUN and SPA/SC could complement each other nicely. What specific moves were you thinking of? Perhaps we could discuss a potential convoy or support for each other's units?
2 ENGLAND -> ITALY: I was thinking that if you were to move your army in TUN to SYR, it could potentially open up opportunities for me to expand my influence in the Mediterranean. Meanwhile, I could offer support to your army in TUN with my fleet in SPA/SC. What do you think about this potential collaboration?
3 ITALY -> ENGLAND: That's an interesting proposal, England. I think it could definitely benefit both of us. However, I was also thinking about the possibility of your fleet in SPA/SC supporting my fleet in MAR. It could help me secure a stronger position in the Mediterranean. What do you think about that?
4 ENGLAND -> ITALY: I like that idea, Italy. Supporting your fleet in MAR could definitely help you solidify your position in the Mediterranean. In return, I was thinking that your army in TUN could support my army in DEN, which would help me secure a stronger foothold in the north. What do you think about that?
5 ITALY -> ENGLAND: I think that's a fair proposal, England. Supporting each other's armies could lead to a strong alliance. However, I was also thinking about the possibility of your fleet in SPA/SC supporting my fleet in MAR, and then my army in TUN could support your army in DEN. This way, we could both gain a stronger foothold in the Mediterranean and the north. What do you think about that?
6 ENGLAND -> ITALY: That sounds like a great plan, Italy. I think we could both benefit from supporting each other's armies. I'll make sure to support your fleet in MAR with my fleet in SPA/SC, and I appreciate your support of my army in DEN with your army in TUN. Let's make it happen!
7 ITALY -> ENGLAND: I'm glad we could come to an agreement, England. I think our alliance will greatly benefit both of us.

This way, we could both gain a stronger foothold in the Mediterranean and the north. What do you think about that?
12 ENGLAND -> ITALY: I'm glad we're discussing potential future moves, Italy. I think supporting each other's expansion into new territories could be very beneficial. I was thinking that if you were to move your army in TUN to SYR, it could open up opportunities for me to expand my influence in the Mediterranean. Meanwhile, I could offer support to your army in TUN with my fleet in SPA/SC. What do you think about this potential collaboration?
13 ITALY -> ENGLAND: I'm glad we're discussing potential future moves, England. I think supporting each other's expansion into new territories could be very beneficial. I was thinking that if you were to move your fleet in SPA/SC to POR, it could open up opportunities for me to expand my influence in the Mediterranean. Meanwhile, I could offer support to your fleet in SPA/SC with my fleet in MAR. What do you think about this potential collaboration?
14 ENGLAND -> ITALY: I think our current agreement is beneficial for both of us, but I was wondering if you'd be open to discussing a potential move of my army from LON to BEL via, which could further strengthen our positions in the north. What are your thoughts on this?
15 ITALY -> ENGLAND: I think that's a good idea, England. Moving your army from LON to BEL via would indeed strengthen our positions in the north. I was also thinking about the possibility of my army in TYR moving to MUN, which could open up opportunities for us to expand our influence in Germany. What do you think about this potential collaboration?
16 ENGLAND -> ITALY: That's an interesting idea, Italy. Moving my army from LON to BEL via would indeed strengthen our positions in the north.

Dialogue Without Flasible:

2 ENGLAND -> ITALY: I completely agree, mutual cooperation can lead to great benefits for both our nations. I was thinking that if you were to move your army in Tyrol to Munich, it would not only strengthen your position but also create an opportunity for me to move my fleet in the North Sea to support you. What are your thoughts on this proposal?
3 ITALY -> ENGLAND: That's an interesting proposal, England. I think moving my army in Tyrol to Munich could be beneficial for both of us. However, I'd like to discuss another option. What if I were to move my fleet in Ionian Sea to support your fleet in the North Sea? Would you be willing to move your fleet in the North Sea to support me in the Mediterranean?
4 ENGLAND -> ITALY: That's an interesting counter-proposal, Italy. Supporting each other in the North Sea and Mediterranean could lead to significant gains for both of us. However, I'd like to clarify that if I were to move my fleet in the North Sea to support you in the Mediterranean, would you be willing to provide me with a guarantee that you'll move your army in Tyrol to Munich to secure the Bavarian region for us?
5 ITALY -> ENGLAND: I'm willing to provide you with a guarantee that I'll move my army in Tyrol to Munich if you agree to move your fleet in the North Sea to support me in the Mediterranean. Let's finalize the details of our agreement.
6 ENGLAND -> ITALY: Excellent, I'm glad we have an agreement in place. Let's make sure to follow through on our commitments and make the most of this opportunity. I'll move my fleet in the North Sea to support you in the Mediterranean, and I expect your army in Tyrol to move to Munich as agreed upon.

8 ENGLAND -> ITALY: I completely agree, mutual cooperation can lead to great benefits for both our nations. Now that we have a mutual understanding, I'd like to discuss potential future collaborations that could benefit both our nations. Perhaps we could work together to limit the growth of Austria and Germany, and create a more balanced power dynamic in Europe.
9 ITALY -> ENGLAND: I agree that limiting the growth of Austria and Germany would be beneficial for both our nations. Perhaps we could discuss ways to support each other in our respective battles against them. For example, if I were to move my army in Venetia to support your fight against Austria, would you be willing to move your fleet in the North Sea to support me against Germany?
10 ENGLAND -> ITALY: That's a great idea, Italy. If you were to move your army in Venetia to support my fight against Austria, I would be willing to move my fleet in the North Sea to support you against Germany.

Dialogue With Plausible: 
0 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Hey France, it's nice to finally have a chance to talk to you. I think we can both agree that the current situation is a bit messy. I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on how we can work together to create a more stable board position for both our countries. Maybe we can discuss some potential moves that would benefit both of us?
1 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I agree that the current situation is messy, but I think we can work together to create a more stable board position. I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on how we can cooperate. Specifically, I was thinking that if you were to move your army in Denmark to support my fleet in the Baltic, it would create a strong alliance and deter other countries from attacking us. What do you think?
2 GERMANY -> FRANCE: That's an interesting proposal, France. I'm not sure I'm ready to commit to moving my army in Denmark just yet, but I do see the potential benefits of an alliance. How about we discuss some other options that could benefit both of us? Perhaps we could explore ways to put pressure on Russia or Italy, and then reassess our positions?
3 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I understand your concerns, Germany. However, I believe that supporting my fleet in the Baltic would be a crucial step in securing our alliance. It would not only deter Russia but also give us a strong foothold in the region. I'm willing to offer you a concession in return, perhaps supporting your move into Sweden or providing military aid in a future turn. What do you think?
4 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I understand your point, France, but I'm still not convinced that moving my army in Denmark is the best move for me. How about we discuss a joint effort to put pressure on Italy instead? Perhaps we could coordinate a move into Piedmont or Venice, and then reassess our positions?
5 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I understand your concerns about Italy, but I believe that supporting my fleet in the Baltic is crucial for our alliance. It would not only deter Russia but also give us a strong foothold in the region. If you're not willing to commit to supporting my fleet, I'm not sure how we can move forward with our alliance. Perhaps we can discuss other ways to cooperate, but I need to see a commitment from you to secure our alliance.
6 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I understand your concerns, France, but I still think we can find a way to cooperate without committing to supporting your fleet in the Baltic just yet. How about we discuss a joint effort to put pressure on Russia instead? Perhaps we could coordinate a move into Sweden or provide military aid in a future turn. This way, we can still work together without making any drastic moves.
7 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I understand your concerns about Russia, Germany. However, I believe that supporting my fleet in the Baltic is crucial for our alliance. It would not only deter Russia but also give us a strong foothold in the region. If you're willing to support my fleet, I'm willing to offer you a concession in return, perhaps supporting your move into Sweden or providing military aid in a future turn. Let's work together to secure our alliance.
8 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I'm willing to compromise, France. How about we make a deal where I support your fleet in the Baltic, but only if you agree to support my move into Sweden in the next turn? This way, we can both benefit from our alliance and secure our positions.
9 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I think we have a deal, Germany. I accept your proposal. You'll support my fleet in the Baltic, and I'll support your move into Sweden in the next turn. Let's finalize the details and make it happen.
10 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I'm glad we could come to an agreement, France. I'll make sure to support your fleet in the Baltic this turn. Let's finalize the details and make it happen. I'm looking forward to seeing the benefits of our alliance in the next turn.

13 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I'm glad we could come to an agreement, Germany. I think our alliance will be beneficial for both of us. Let's make sure to communicate regularly and adjust our strategies as needed to secure our positions on the board.
14 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I'm glad we could come to an agreement, France. I'm looking forward to seeing the benefits of our alliance in the next turn. I think we should discuss our next moves and make sure we're on the same page. Perhaps we can coordinate a joint effort to put pressure on Italy or Russia, and then reassess our positions.
15 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I think we should focus on solidifying our alliance by supporting each other's moves. Perhaps we can discuss specific army movements that can be made this turn for our mutual benefit.
16 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I think we should discuss specific army movements that can be made this turn for our mutual benefit. For example, I could move my fleet from Edinburgh to Norway, supporting your fleet in the Baltic, while you could support my move into Sweden. What do you think?
17 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I think that's a great idea, Germany. Moving your fleet from Edinburgh to Norway would indeed support my fleet in the Baltic, and I would be happy to support your move into Sweden. Let's make it happen and solidify our alliance.
18 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I'm glad we could come to an agreement, France. I think we should discuss our next moves and make sure we're on the same page. Perhaps we can coordinate a joint effort to put pressure on Italy or Russia, and then reassess our positions. What do you think about moving your army in Austria to support my move into Piedmont?
19 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I'm glad we're on the same page, Germany. Moving your fleet from Edinburgh to Norway and supporting my move into Sweden is a great step forward for our alliance. Let's focus on solidifying our positions and making sure we're prepared for any potential threats from other countries. What do you think about moving your army in Denmark to support my fleet in the Baltic in the next turn?
20 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I think moving my army in Denmark to support your fleet in the Baltic in the next turn is a great idea, France. It would solidify our alliance and deter Russia from making any aggressive moves. What do you think about moving your fleet in the North Sea to support my move into Sweden?
Dialogue Without Flasible: 
0 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Hi France, glad to see we're both still in the game. I think we can both agree that Italy is getting a bit too powerful. Would you be open to discussing a potential alliance to take them down a peg?
1 FRANCE -> GERMANY: Hi Germany, I agree that Italy is getting too powerful. I'm open to discussing an alliance to take them down. What did you have in mind?
2 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I think we could work together to take down Italy. How about we support each other in taking some of their centers? I could support your army in taking Venice, and in return, you could support my army in taking Rome.

5 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I like the idea of taking down Austria as well. Let's coordinate our moves to make sure we're not stepping on each other's toes. How about I move my army in Belgium to support your move on Austria, and in return, you support my move on Venice?

18 GERMANY -> FRANCE: That's an interesting idea, France. Supporting your army in taking Spain could definitely put more pressure on Italy. However, I was thinking that we should also consider supporting each other in taking some of Austria's centers.

2 GERMANY -> TURKEY: That sounds like a good plan for you, but I was thinking maybe we could work together to secure Serbia for you this turn. If you move your army in Rumania to Bulgaria, I could support you with my army in Budapest. What do you think?

17 TURKEY -> GERMANY: I think supporting your army in Galicia to attack Austria's army in Vienna is a good idea, Germany. But I was thinking, what if we also support my fleet in the Aegean to attack Greece at the same time? That would give us an even stronger presence in the region.
18 GERMANY -> TURKEY: I think that's a great idea, Turkey. Supporting my army in Galicia to attack Austria's army in Vienna, and your fleet in the Aegean to attack Greece at the same time would give us a strong presence in the region. Let's work together to take Vienna and Greece next turn.

Dialogue With Plausible: 
0 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Hello France, I hope this conversation finds you well. I've been reviewing the current board situation, and I think it's essential for us to discuss our moves for this turn. As Germany, I'm looking to make some strategic advancements that could benefit both our countries. I'd like to propose a potential alliance to ensure our mutual growth and security. What are your thoughts on this, and are you open to discussing some possible moves that could benefit us both?
1 FRANCE -> GERMANY: Hello Germany, I appreciate your willingness to discuss a potential alliance. As France, I'm always open to exploring opportunities for mutual growth and security. However, I'd like to know more about your proposed alliance and what specific moves you have in mind for this turn. What do you think would be a beneficial move for both our countries?
2 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I appreciate your willingness to consider an alliance, France. As I see it, a potential move that could benefit both our countries is for me to move my fleet from NWG to EDI, supporting your army in PIC. This would not only secure a vital center for you but also create a strong defensive position for both our countries. What do you think about this proposal?
3 FRANCE -> GERMANY: That's an interesting proposal, Germany. However, I'm not convinced that moving your fleet to EDI would be the best move for both our countries. I think it would be more beneficial if you were to support my army in BUR, allowing me to take MUN and create a stronger position for France. What do you think about this alternative proposal?
4 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I understand your concerns, France. Supporting your army in BUR would indeed be a beneficial move for France. However, I'm still hesitant to give up on the opportunity to secure EDI. Would you be open to a compromise, where I move my fleet to NTH instead, supporting your northern flank and keeping the pressure on England? This way, we can still work together while also considering our individual interests.
5 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Germany. Moving your fleet to NTH could be a good alternative, but I'd like to propose another option.

This would allow me to take MUN and create a stronger position for France, while also keeping the pressure on England. What do you think about this proposal?

What do you think about this alternative?
7 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I'm interested in your counter-proposal, Germany. Supporting your army in PRU with my army in PIC could be a good option, but I'd like to know more about your long-term plans and how this move would benefit France in the future. Can you tell me more about your strategy and how we can work together to achieve our goals?
8 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I understand your concerns, France. Supporting your army in BUR with my army in PRU and moving my army in MUN to hold is a viable option, but I'd like to reiterate the benefits of supporting my army in PRU with your army in PIC.

Let's discuss the long-term benefits of this move and how it can lead to a stronger alliance between our countries.

Perhaps we can find a way to compromise and achieve both goals. What do you think about a joint attack on England, with your army in BUR supporting my army in PRU, and my fleet in NWG supporting your army in PIC?
11 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I think we've discussed the options thoroughly, Germany. Let's summarize the benefits of each move and make a decision.

1 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Austria. A mutually beneficial solution would indeed be desirable. I've been considering a move to Denmark, but I'd be willing to hold off if you're willing to support my move to Kiel. What are your thoughts on this proposal?
2 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I'm open to supporting your move to Kiel, but I'd like to discuss a potential trade-off. Would you be willing to support my move to Rumania, or perhaps hold off on your move to Denmark in favor of a more mutually beneficial arrangement? Let's explore our options.

Dialogue Without Flasible: 
0 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: Austria, I see you're getting aggressive. What's your plan?
1 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I'm just trying to protect myself from your aggressive moves, Russia. I'm not looking for a fight, but I won't back down if threatened.
2 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I'm not looking to fight either, Austria. But I do need to secure my borders. Would you be willing to let me take Rumania without a fight? It would ease tensions between us and give us both room to focus on other threats.
3 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I'm not interested in giving up Rumania without a fight. It's a key location for me, and I need to protect my borders. How about we discuss a mutual agreement to not attack each other this turn, and focus on other threats instead?
4 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I understand your concerns, Austria. How about we make a deal? I'll support your move to Bulgaria if you support my move to Rumania. It's a fair trade, and we can both benefit from it.
5 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I'm not sure I trust you, Russia. Why should I support your move to Rumania when it's clear you're trying to expand your territory? What's in it for me?
6 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I understand your concerns, Austria. But let's be realistic, I have a fleet in the Black Sea and an army in Ukraine. If I wanted to take Rumania, I could do so easily. Instead, I'm offering you a deal. I'll support your move to Bulgaria if you support my move to Rumania. It's a fair trade, and we can both benefit from it. Refuse, and we'll have to consider other options.
7 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I understand your position, Russia, but I'm still not convinced that supporting your move to Rumania is in my best interest. What else can you offer me to sweeten the deal?
8 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I understand your concerns, Austria. But I think we're at a critical point here. If we don't come to an agreement, things could escalate quickly. I'm willing to throw in a sweetener - I'll support your move to Serbia as well, if you support my move to Rumania. That's two centers for you, and one for me. It's a fair deal, and it will give us both some breathing room to focus on other threats.
9 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I'm still not convinced that supporting your move to Rumania is the right decision for me, but I'm willing to consider it. Can you offer me any guarantees that you won't turn on me once you've got what you want?
10 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I understand your concerns, Austria. I'm willing to make a commitment to you. If you support my move to Rumania, I'll not only support your move to Bulgaria, but I'll also guarantee not to attack you for the next two turns. That's a promise from me, and I'll stick to it. Let's work together and secure our borders.
11 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I appreciate your commitment, Russia. I'm willing to accept your offer. Let's work together and secure our borders. I'll support your move to Rumania, and you can support my move to Bulgaria and Serbia. Let's make it official and ensure a peaceful turn.
12 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: Excellent, Austria. I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Let's make sure to follow through on our commitments and secure our borders.

15 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I'm glad our agreement is working out, Russia. Let's continue to work together to secure our borders and focus on other threats.

16 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I think supporting your move to Greece is a good idea, Austria. It will give us both more room to maneuver and secure our borders. Let's work together to make it happen.
17 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I'm glad we're on the same page, Russia. Supporting my move to Greece will definitely help us both secure our borders. What do you think about supporting my move to Turkey as well? It would give us a strong foothold in the region and help us counter any potential threats from Italy.
18 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I think supporting your move to Turkey is a bit too ambitious, Austria. Let's focus on securing our current borders and then we can discuss further expansion. How about we discuss a mutual defense pact to ensure our security in the region?
19 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I think a mutual defense pact is a great idea, Russia. It would give us both the security we need to focus on other threats. Let's discuss the terms of the pact and make it official.
20 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I think a mutual defense pact is a great idea, Austria. Let's discuss the terms of the pact and make it official. I propose we guarantee each other's security in the region and work together to counter any potential threats from other powers. What do you think?

Dialogue With Plausible: 
0 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Hey Italy, thanks for supporting me last turn. I'm thinking of moving my army in Trieste to Budapest. What do you think? Would you be able to support me with that?
1 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Hey Austria, I'm not sure about that move. Budapest is a bit far from our current position and I'm not sure it's the best use of our resources. What's your reasoning behind that move? Are you trying to put pressure on Russia?
2 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I understand your concerns, but I think it's a good opportunity to put pressure on Russia. If we can take Budapest, it would give us a strong foothold in the region. Would you be willing to support me with your fleet in the Ionian Sea?
3 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I understand your point, but I'm still unsure if it's the best move for us. What if we focus on securing Venice and Trieste instead? Would you be willing to support me in holding those centers?
4 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I understand your concerns about securing Venice and Trieste, but I think taking Budapest would give us a strong bargaining chip against Russia. If we can work together, we can make sure Russia doesn't get too powerful. Would you be willing to support me in taking Budapest if I support you in holding Venice and Trieste?
5 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I understand your point, but I think we should focus on securing our current centers before expanding further. How about we work together to hold Trieste and Venice this turn, and then we can discuss further moves afterwards?
6 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I understand your concerns about focusing on our current centers, but I think we can't ignore the opportunity to put pressure on Russia. How about we compromise and move my army in Trieste to support your fleet in the Ionian Sea, and then we can discuss further moves afterwards? This way, we can keep our options open and still show Russia that we're not to be underestimated.
7 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I think your compromise is reasonable. Let's move your army in Trieste to support my fleet in the Ionian Sea, and then we can discuss further moves afterwards. This way, we can keep our options open and still show Russia that we're not to be underestimated. What do you think?
8 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I'm glad we could come to a compromise. Let's make it official and move my army in Trieste to support your fleet in the Ionian Sea. This way, we can work together to keep our options open and show Russia that we're not to be underestimated.

10 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Let's make sure to coordinate our moves carefully to maximize our gains. By the way, have you thought about supporting me in taking Serbia next turn? It would give us a strong foothold in the Balkans.
11 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I'm not sure about supporting you in taking Serbia next turn, Austria. I think we should focus on securing our current centers before expanding further. What's your plan for taking Serbia and how does it benefit us in the long run?
12 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I understand your concerns about securing our current centers, but I think taking Serbia would give us a strong foothold in the Balkans and put pressure on Turkey. If we work together, we can make sure Turkey doesn't get too powerful. Would you be willing to support me in taking Serbia if I support you in holding Venice and Trieste?
13 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I'm still not convinced that taking Serbia is the best move for us. How does it benefit us in the long run and what's your plan for holding it?
14 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I understand your concerns about securing our current centers, but I think taking Serbia would give us a strong foothold in the Balkans and put pressure on Turkey. If we work together, we can make sure Turkey doesn't get too powerful. I'll support you in holding Venice and Trieste if you support me in taking Serbia. It's a win-win situation for both of us.
15 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I understand your persistence, but I still think we should focus on securing our current centers before expanding further. Can we discuss other ways to put pressure on Turkey and Russia without taking Serbia?
16 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I understand your concerns about securing our current centers, but I think taking Serbia would give us a strong foothold in the Balkans and put pressure on Turkey. Can we discuss the possibility of supporting each other in taking Serbia and holding Venice and Trieste simultaneously? This way, we can ensure that we're both benefiting from the move.
17 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I understand your persistence, but I still think we should focus on securing our current centers before expanding further. Can we discuss other ways to put pressure on Turkey and Russia without taking Serbia? Perhaps we can work together to take Albania or Greece instead?
18 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I understand your concerns about securing our current centers, but I think taking Serbia would give us a strong foothold in the Balkans and put pressure on Turkey. Can we discuss the possibility of supporting each other in taking Serbia and holding Venice and Trieste simultaneously, and then we can work together to take Albania or Greece afterwards? This way, we can ensure that we're both benefiting from the move and putting pressure on Turkey and Russia.
19 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I think taking Albania or Greece instead of Serbia could be a good option for us. It would give us a foothold in the Balkans and put pressure on Turkey without committing to a long and costly battle for Serbia. What do you think?
20 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I think taking Albania or Greece instead of Serbia could be a good option for us. It would give us a foothold in the Balkans and put pressure on Turkey without committing to a long and costly battle for Serbia. What do you think we should do to make it happen?

2 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: That sounds like a great idea! Supporting me in taking Pie would be a huge help. Do you think we could also get your fleet in Ion to support my army in Tri in case Germany tries to attack?
3 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Yeah, that sounds like a good plan. I'll support you in taking Pie and I'll also support your army in Tri with my fleet in Ion. Let's work together to take down France and then we can focus on Germany.
4 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: That's a great plan! Let's make sure to coordinate our moves carefully to take out France and then focus on Germany. I'll make sure to support your fleet in Ion with my army in Tri.
5 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I'm thinking we should also consider supporting each other in other areas, like Venice or Tyrolia. What do you think?

10 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I think we should also consider supporting each other in taking out Russia's fleet in the Baltic Sea. If we can take that out, it would give us a big advantage in the region. What do you think about that?
11 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: That's a good point about taking out Russia's fleet in the Baltic Sea. Do you think we could also support each other in taking out Germany's army in Bohemia? That would give us a strong foothold in the region and make it harder for Germany to defend itself.
12 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I completely agree with you about taking out Germany's army in Bohemia. If we can coordinate our moves, I think we can make it happen. What's your plan for supporting me in taking out Bohemia?
13 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I completely agree with your plan to take out Germany's army in Bohemia. Let's make sure to coordinate our moves carefully to ensure success.

Dialogue With Plausible: 
0 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Hey Italy, thanks for considering my previous suggestion. I think our plan is still on track.

This way, we can ensure a strong presence in the area and prepare for future moves.

Dialogue With Plausible: 
0 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: Hello France, I'm England from England. It's great to finally talk to you. I think we both know that our countries have a lot to gain from working together. I'd love to discuss some possible alliances and moves that could benefit both of us. What are your thoughts?
1 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: Hello England, I'm France from France. It's great to finally talk to you too. I agree that our countries have a lot to gain from working together. I'm interested in discussing possible alliances and moves that could benefit both of us. What specific moves did you have in mind?
2 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I think one possible move that could benefit both of us is if you were to move your army in Ruhr to Kiel, it would put pressure on Germany and give us more room to maneuver. What do you think about that?
3 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: That's an interesting proposal, England. Moving my army from Ruhr to Kiel could indeed put pressure on Germany. However, I'd like to discuss another option that could benefit both of us. What if I were to move my fleet from Wester Mediterranean to Spain/SC, and you were to move your fleet from North Sea to Denmark? This could give us a better position to negotiate with Germany and Austria. What are your thoughts on this?
4 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: That's an interesting proposal, France. Moving your fleet from Wester Mediterranean to Spain/SC and my fleet from North Sea to Denmark could indeed give us a better position to negotiate with Germany and Austria.

This could put more pressure on Germany and give us more room to maneuver. What are your thoughts on this?
5 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: I like your proposal, England. Moving your army from Yorkshire to Sweden and my army from Munich to Bohemia could indeed put more pressure on Germany and give us more room to maneuver. However, I'd like to discuss another option. What if I were to move my fleet from Wester Mediterranean to Tunisia, and you were to move your fleet from North Sea to Baltic Sea? This could give us a better position to negotiate with Germany and Austria. What are your thoughts on this?
6 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I think we're making good progress, France. I like the idea of moving my army from Yorkshire to Sweden and your army from Munich to Bohemia. However, I'd like to discuss another option. What if I were to move my fleet from North Sea to Baltic Sea, and you were to move your army from Belgium to Ruhr? This could give us an even stronger position against Germany. What are your thoughts on this?
7 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: I think we're making good progress, England. Moving your army from Yorkshire to Sweden and my army from Munich to Bohemia is a great idea. However, I'd like to discuss another option. What if I were to move my army from Picardy to Belgium, and you were to move your fleet from North Sea to Baltic Sea? This could give us an even stronger position against Germany. What are your thoughts on this?
8 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I think we're getting close to a mutually beneficial agreement, France. I like the idea of moving my army from Yorkshire to Sweden and your army from Munich to Bohemia. However, I'd like to discuss another option.

9 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: I think we're getting close to a mutually beneficial agreement, England. I like the idea of moving your army from Yorkshire to Sweden and my army from Munich to Bohemia.

10 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I think we're getting close to a mutually beneficial agreement, France. I like the idea of moving my army from Yorkshire to Sweden and your army from Munich to Bohemia. How about we finalize the agreement and make the moves?

Let me know if this works for you.
11 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: I think we've finalized a great agreement, England. I'm willing to commit to moving my army from Munich to Bohemia, and my fleet from Wester Mediterranean to Spain/SC, if you're willing to move your fleet from North Sea to Baltic Sea, and your army from Yorkshire to Sweden. Let's make these moves and work together to benefit both our countries.

Let's continue to work together to achieve our goals. I think it's also important for us to keep the lines of communication open and discuss any future moves that could benefit both our countries. What are your thoughts on that?
15 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: I completely agree, England. Keeping the lines of communication open is crucial for our mutual success. I'd like to propose that we schedule regular check-ins to discuss our progress and any future moves that could benefit both our countries. What do you think?
16 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I completely agree, France. Keeping the lines of communication open is crucial for our mutual success. I'd like to propose that we discuss our progress and any future moves that could benefit both our countries in more detail. What specific moves do you think we should consider making in the next turn?
17 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: I completely agree, England. Keeping the lines of communication open is crucial for our mutual success. I'd like to propose that we discuss our progress and any future moves that could benefit both our countries in more detail. Specifically, I think we should consider moving my army from Picardy to Belgium, and your fleet from North Sea to Baltic Sea. What are your thoughts on this?
18 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I think we've made great progress, France. I'd like to discuss some specific moves that could benefit both our countries in the next turn. What are your thoughts on me moving my fleet from Baltic Sea to Sweden, and you moving your army from Bohemia to Munich? This could give us an even stronger position against Germany and Austria.
19 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: I think we've made great progress, England. I'd like to discuss some specific moves that could benefit both our countries in the next turn. What are your thoughts on me moving my army from Belgium to Ruhr, and you moving your fleet from Baltic Sea to Sweden? This could give us an even stronger position against Germany and Austria.
20 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I think we've made great progress, France. I'd like to discuss some specific moves that could benefit both our countries in the next turn.

Dialogue Without Flasible: 
0 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: Hello France, I hope you're doing well. I wanted to discuss our current board position and see if we can come to some mutually beneficial agreements. Specifically, I'm interested in exploring ways to work together to counter the growing threat of Austria. Would you be open to discussing some potential moves that could help us both?
1 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: Bonjour England, I'm doing well, thank you for asking. I'm more than happy to discuss ways to counter the growing threat of Austria. In fact, I've been thinking about it a lot lately. I've noticed that Austria has a strong presence in the Balkans, and it's only a matter of time before they start making moves towards our borders. I think it would be beneficial for both of us to work together to prevent that from happening. What specific moves were you thinking of making to counter Austria's influence?
2 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I completely agree with your assessment of the situation. In fact, I've been thinking that we could work together to take out Austria's unit in Rumania. If you were to move your unit from Greece to Rumania, and I were to move my unit from Sweden to Rumania, we could take out Austria's unit and gain a strategic advantage. What do you think?
3 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: That's an interesting proposal, England. I like the idea of taking out Austria's unit in Rumania. However, I'm concerned about the potential risks involved. If we move our units to Rumania, we'll be leaving our borders vulnerable to Austrian counter-attacks. I think we need to consider a more strategic approach. What if we were to coordinate a simultaneous attack on Austria's units in Serbia and Greece instead? That way, we could weaken Austria's position in the Balkans without exposing ourselves to unnecessary risks. What do you think?
4 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I understand your concerns about the risks involved, France. However, I think we need to weigh the risks against the potential benefits. If we can successfully take out Austria's unit in Rumania, it would give us a significant advantage in the region. Perhaps we could compromise and move my unit from Sweden to Rumania, while you move your unit from Greece to Serbia, and then we can reassess the situation after this turn. What do you think?
5 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: I think that's a reasonable compromise, England. Let's move your unit from Sweden to Rumania, and I'll move my unit from Greece to Serbia. We can reassess the situation after this turn and see how Austria responds. In the meantime, I'd like to discuss potential future moves to further weaken Austria's position in the Balkans. What are your thoughts on a potential joint attack on Austria's unit in Bulgaria?
6 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: That sounds like a good plan, France. I'm glad we could come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's make sure to follow through on our commitments and reassess the situation after this turn. In the meantime, I've been thinking about our long-term strategy and I was wondering if you'd be open to discussing potential alliances or agreements with other countries to further our goals.
7 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: I completely agree with your thoughts on exploring alliances or agreements with other countries to further our goals. In fact, I've been thinking about reaching out to Germany to discuss potential cooperation against Austria. What are your thoughts on that?

1 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: I'm open to discussing mutual benefits, but limiting Austria's growth might not be the best approach for me. What specific proposals do you have in mind, Turkey?
2 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: I understand your hesitation, but I think it's crucial to address Austria's expansion. Perhaps we could discuss a temporary alliance to slow them down, and in return, I could offer you support in another region of your interest?
3 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: I'm interested in hearing more about your proposal, Turkey. What specific regions or centers are you thinking of supporting me in, and what kind of temporary alliance are you proposing to slow down Austria's growth?
4 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: I was thinking of supporting you in Greece or Serbia, in exchange for your support in Bulgaria or Rumania. This would allow us to limit Austria's growth and create a more balanced board. What do you think?
5 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: That's an interesting proposal, Turkey. I'm willing to consider supporting you in Bulgaria or Rumania, but I'd like to discuss the specifics of the alliance and the benefits it would bring to Austria. What kind of support are you thinking of providing in Greece or Serbia, and how would you envision our temporary alliance working?
6 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: I understand your concerns, Austria. Let me propose a more specific plan. If you support me in Bulgaria, I can move my fleet in Constantinople to support you in Greece.

7 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: I think your proposal is intriguing, Turkey. However, I'd like to explore the possibility of supporting you in Bulgaria while also considering other options for limiting Austria's growth.

8 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: I understand your concerns, Austria. To alleviate them, I'm willing to propose a more formal agreement.

This would give us both the security to focus on limiting Austria's growth and expanding our own influence. What are your thoughts on such an agreement?
9 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: I think a mutual defense pact could be beneficial for both of us, Turkey. However, I'd like to discuss the specifics of the agreement and ensure that it aligns with Austria's long-term goals.

We can review and adjust the terms as needed. What do you think?
11 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: I think the draft of the mutual defense pact is a good starting point, Turkey. However, I'd like to propose a slight modification to ensure Austria's interests are better protected. What if we add a clause that guarantees Austria's control over Serbia in exchange for our support in Bulgaria and Rumania? This would give us a stronger foothold in the region and create a more balanced power dynamic.
12 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: I think adding a clause that guarantees Austria's control over Serbia is an interesting proposal, Austria.

1 TURKEY -> FRANCE: Hi France, glad we could work together last turn. I'm open to taking down Austria and Russia, but I need to make sure my position is secure. What are your plans for taking down Austria this turn? Are you going to take GRE or do you need my help?
2 FRANCE -> TURKEY: I'm planning to take GRE this turn, but I could use your help to secure it. If you could move your army in BUL to SER, that would be a big help. Additionally, if you could also move your fleet in BLA to RUM, that would put pressure on Austria and make it harder for them to respond to our moves.
3 TURKEY -> FRANCE: That sounds like a good plan, France. I'll move my army in BUL to SER and my fleet in BLA to RUM. In return, can you support my army in ARM to SEV? This would help me secure a key position and put pressure on Russia.

1 FRANCE -> TURKEY: Thanks for considering supporting my move to Greece! That would be a huge help. I'm planning to order AEG-GRE anyway to cut potential support on an attack against BUL. What do you think about that?
2 TURKEY -> FRANCE: That sounds good to me. Would you like me to cut support from the Austrian for Greece or take Sev?
3 FRANCE -> TURKEY: Cut support for me to take GRE if you can. England has stabbed me and I'll need the build.
4 TURKEY -> FRANCE: Ok, I'll cut support from the Austrian for Greece. I'll also move BUL-SER if I can spare it.

13 FRANCE -> TURKEY: I'm glad we're on the same page, Turkey. Now that we've discussed our plans, I think we should start thinking about how to divide up the spoils. What do you think about a potential alliance to take down Russia as well? They're getting a bit too powerful for my taste.
14 TURKEY -> FRANCE: I'm open to discussing an alliance to take down Russia, but I think we should focus on taking down Austria and England first. Once we've secured those centers, we can start thinking about taking on Russia. What do you think about that plan?
15 FRANCE -> TURKEY: I completely agree with your plan to focus on taking down Austria and England first.

Dialogue With Plausible: 
0 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: Greetings, Russia! I hope this message finds you well. I've been reviewing our current board position and I think it's essential we discuss potential cooperation to ensure our mutual interests are secured. Are you open to discussing possible moves that could benefit both our nations?
1 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: Greetings, Germany! I appreciate your willingness to cooperate. I've been analyzing the board, and I believe we can mutually benefit from coordinating our moves. Specifically, I'd like to discuss the possibility of your army in Munich supporting my army in Kiel, allowing me to move into Denmark. This would not only strengthen our positions but also create opportunities for future cooperation. What are your thoughts on this proposal?
2 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: I appreciate your proposal, Russia. Supporting your army in Kiel with my army in Munich is an interesting idea. However, I'd like to explore other possibilities that could benefit both our nations. What are your thoughts on supporting my fleet in Edinburgh with your fleet in Norway? This could create a strong presence in the North Sea and open up opportunities for future cooperation.
3 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: I think supporting your fleet in Edinburgh with my fleet in Norway is an intriguing idea, Germany. However, I believe my initial proposal would be more beneficial to both our nations.

What concerns do you have about supporting my army in Kiel, and are you willing to consider a compromise?
4 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: I understand your concerns, Russia, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I still believe supporting my fleet in Edinburgh with your fleet in Norway could be a more strategic move in the long run. It would allow us to control the North Sea and potentially limit England's expansion. Perhaps we could compromise and support each other's moves simultaneously? I'm open to discussing the details and finding a mutually beneficial solution.
5 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: I understand your concerns, Germany, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise.

In return, you could support my army in Munich with your army in Warsaw. This would create a strong alliance and open up opportunities for future cooperation. What are your thoughts on this proposal?
7 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: I'm intrigued by your proposal, Germany. Supporting my army in Sweden with your fleet in Edinburgh could be a viable option. However, I'd like to propose a slight modification.

This would create a strong alliance and limit the potential threats from France and England. What are your thoughts on this revised proposal?
8 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: I think your revised proposal is a step in the right direction, Russia. Supporting my army in Munich with your army in Warsaw, and in return, supporting your army in Kiel with my army in Munich could be a strong alliance.

1 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: Hello Germany, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've been reviewing the board and I agree that a mutually beneficial agreement can be reached. I'm interested in exploring possibilities of cooperation, especially in the north. What specific moves do you have in mind for this turn?
2 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: I'm glad you're open to cooperation, Russia. I've been thinking that we could work together to take down Austria. If you're willing to move your unit in Serbia to support my unit in Trieste, I could move my unit in Vienna to support your unit in Budapest. This would give us both a stronger foothold in the region and limit Austria's options. What do you think?
3 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: That's an interesting proposal, Germany. I like the idea of taking down Austria, but I'm not sure I'm willing to commit to supporting your unit in Trieste just yet. What else can you offer to sweeten the deal? Perhaps we could discuss a simultaneous attack on Austria from multiple fronts?
4 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: I understand your hesitation, Russia. Let me think for a moment... Ah, I have it! If you agree to support my unit in Trieste, I'll make sure to move my unit in Munich to support your unit in Warsaw.

1 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I'm open to discussing a joint effort against England, but I need to know what you have in mind. What specific moves were you thinking of making this turn?
2 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Well, I was thinking that you could move your fleet in WES to ENG, and I could move my army in KIE to HOL. That would put pressure on England from both sides and give us a good chance to take out one of their centers. What do you think?

1 ITALY -> TURKEY: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate you considering my proposal. Attacking Venice to Tyrolia would cut the support Germany has on Vienna, making it an easier target for you to take. As for what's in it for me, I would gain a strategic advantage by weakening Germany's position and creating an opportunity for us to work together to take them down. It's a win-win situation.
2 TURKEY -> ITALY: I see your point, but I'm still not convinced. What's to stop Germany from simply moving their unit from Tyrolia to Vienna to replace the lost support? And how do you plan to ensure that I'll be able to take Vienna successfully after you attack Tyrolia?
3 ITALY -> TURKEY: I understand your concerns about Germany replacing the lost support, but I believe it's a risk worth taking. If we work together, we can ensure that Germany is weakened and doesn't get a chance to recover. As for guaranteeing your success in taking Vienna, I'm willing to offer you a deal. If you agree to work with me, I'll support your move to Vienna with one of my units, making it a sure thing.
4 TURKEY -> ITALY: I appreciate your willingness to support my move to Vienna, but I still have some doubts about the success of this plan.

5 ITALY -> TURKEY: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your caution. However, I believe our combined efforts can ensure Germany's weakness and our mutual benefit.

Dialogue Without Flasible: 
0 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: Hey France, thanks for supporting me to Holland last turn. I'm thinking of moving my army to Belgium this turn. What's your plan for this turn? Are you willing to support me to Belgium or do you have other plans?
1 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: Ah, nice move to Belgium! I was thinking of supporting you there, but I'd like to discuss the situation with Turkey first. Have you got any insight on their plans? They've been quite vague with me, and I'm worried they might be plotting something with Austria.
2 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I've had some conversations with Turkey, and I think they're more interested in taking centers from Italy. I don't think they're planning to stab Austria just yet. But I do agree we should be cautious. If you support me to Belgium, I can offer you a favor in return, maybe helping you with Munich or something?
3 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: That sounds like a good plan. If I support you to Belgium, would you be willing to help me take Munich in the fall? I'd like to make sure Austria doesn't get too strong.

9 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: That's a great idea, supporting you to Denmark would really help contain Germany's expansion. I'll make sure to consider that for the fall. In the meantime, let's focus on executing our current plan and keep an eye on Turkey and Austria.

19 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: I think an alliance with Russia could be beneficial for both of us, especially considering their strong presence in the north.

0 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Good day, Germany. I hope our previous agreements have been beneficial to both our countries. I'm interested in discussing potential moves for this turn that could strengthen our alliance and secure more supply centers. Are you open to cooperating?
1 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Good day, England. I'm pleased to hear that our previous agreements have been beneficial to both our countries. I'm open to cooperating and discussing potential moves that could strengthen our alliance and secure more supply centers. However, I'd like to explore opportunities that would specifically benefit Germany's board position. Are you willing to consider supporting my army in Prussia to Berlin, or perhaps supporting my move from Belgium to Holland?
2 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I'm willing to consider supporting your move from Belgium to Holland, but I'd like to discuss a potential trade-off. If I were to support your move, would you be willing to support my fleet in the North Sea moving to Belgium, potentially setting up a strong alliance in the region? 
3 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I think that's a reasonable request, England. If you were to support my move from Belgium to Holland, I'd be willing to support your fleet in the North Sea moving to Belgium.

This could be a great opportunity for both our countries to gain a foothold in the region.
4 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I understand your interest in moving your army from Prussia to Berlin, but I'd like to reiterate the benefits of supporting my fleet in the North Sea moving to Belgium.

I understand your concern about securing your western border, but I'm not sure if moving your army in Hol to Bel would be beneficial to both of us.

In fact, I think it's essential that we work together to limit their growth and prevent them from becoming a threat to our positions. I'd like to propose that we also consider supporting each other's moves in the Mediterranean, perhaps by supporting your army in TYR to move to VEN, and in return, you support my fleet in ION to move to GRE.

2 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I'm glad you think so, Italy. With your support, I'm confident we can make this move work. Do you think Russia will try to move into Galicia or Warsaw in response?
3 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: That's a great point, I think Russia will probably try to move into Galicia. But if we can secure Budapest, that would put pressure on them and give us an advantage. What do you think about supporting my fleet in Trieste with your army in Venice, to ensure we can hold it against any Turkish or Russian aggression?
4 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: That's a great idea, Italy. Supporting your fleet in Trieste with my army in Venice would ensure we can hold it against Turkish or Russian aggression. What do you think about also supporting my army in Budapest with your army in Venice, to put even more pressure on Russia?

Dialogue Without Flasible: 
0 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Hey, thanks for the support on Trieste last turn. I was thinking, if you could support me into Rumania this turn, that would really help me out. What do you think?
1 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: That sounds like a good plan, but I was thinking, would it be possible for you to support me into Bulgaria instead? That would really help me out in the long run.
2 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I understand your point, but I'm not sure if supporting you into Bulgaria would be the best move for me right now. How about we compromise and you support me into Rumania, and then next turn we can discuss supporting you into Bulgaria?
3 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I understand your concerns, but supporting you into Rumania would really help me out in the short term. If I support you into Bulgaria, I'd be putting myself in a weaker position. How about we compromise and I support you into Greece instead? That way, we can both benefit from the move.
4 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I understand your point, and supporting you into Greece could be beneficial for both of us. However, I'm still concerned about my position in Rumania. How about we make a deal where you support me into Rumania this turn, and then I'll support you into Greece next turn? That way, we can both get what we want.
5 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I think that's a fair deal. Supporting you into Rumania this turn and then you supporting me into Greece next turn could be beneficial for both of us. Let's make it happen.

8 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I'm glad we were able to come to an agreement last turn. Now that we've secured Rumania, I think it's time for me to make a move into Serbia. I'll make sure to support you into Greece if you're willing to support me into Serbia this turn. Let's keep working together to strengthen our positions.
9 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I think we've been working well together so far, but I'm concerned about your move into Serbia. Wouldn't it be better for both of us if you supported me into Greece instead? We could both benefit from that move.
10 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I understand your concerns about my move into Serbia, but I think it's necessary for my position. If you support me into Serbia, I'll make sure to support you into Greece next turn. We can still benefit from each other's moves.
11 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I completely understand your concerns about Serbia, but I think it's crucial for both of us to focus on Greece right now. If we can secure Greece, it will open up more opportunities for us to work together and strengthen our positions. What do you think about supporting each other into Greece this turn?

13 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I'm glad we've been able to work together so far. Now that we've secured Greece, I think it's time for us to discuss our next moves. Would you be willing to support me into Bulgaria this turn? It would really help me out and open up more opportunities for us to work together.
14 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I'm glad we've been able to work together so far. Supporting you into Bulgaria could be beneficial for both of us, but I need to consider my position in Serbia as well.

15 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I think we've been working well together so far, but I'm starting to get concerned about your moves in the Balkans. If you're willing to support me into Bulgaria this turn, I'd be more than happy to return the favor and support you into Serbia next turn. Let's keep working together to strengthen our positions.

13 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I'm glad we're on the same page, England. Now that we have a plan in place for this turn, I'd like to discuss some potential future moves in more detail. How do you think we can work together to limit Russia's influence in the region and secure more supply centers?
14 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I completely agree, Germany. Limiting Russia's influence in the region is crucial for both of our countries. I think we should also discuss potential future moves in the Mediterranean, particularly in regards to Italy's expansion. What are your thoughts on supporting each other in that region?
15 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I think supporting each other in the Mediterranean could be beneficial for both of us. Perhaps we could discuss a potential joint move against Italy, or at least limit their expansion in the region. What are your thoughts on this matter, England?

Dialogue Without Flasible: 
0 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Hello England, it's been a while since our last conversation. I've been thinking about our previous agreements and I'm wondering if we can revisit the idea of a potential alliance between Germany and England. Perhaps we can discuss ways to mutually benefit each other and work together to achieve our goals.
1 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Hello Germany, I'm open to revisiting the idea of an alliance between Germany and England. However, I'd like to discuss some specific ways in which we can mutually benefit each other. What did you have in mind?
2 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I've been thinking that we could work together to limit France's growth in the region. Perhaps we could coordinate our movements to ensure that they don't gain too much ground. What are your thoughts on this?
3 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I think that's a great idea, Germany. Limiting France's growth would certainly benefit both of our countries. I was thinking that we could work together to take out some of their northern centers, perhaps even take Brest or Picardy. What do you think about supporting my fleet in the North Sea with your army in Denmark? Would you be willing to make a move in support of my fleet this turn?
4 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I think that's a great idea, England. Supporting your fleet in the North Sea with my army in Denmark could be a powerful move. However, I'd like to propose a slight modification to the plan. What if we also consider moving my army in Kiel to Ruhr, which would not only support your fleet but also put pressure on France's borders? This way, we can ensure that France is caught off guard and doesn't have a chance to react quickly.
5 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I like the modification you proposed, Germany. Moving your army in Kiel to Ruhr would certainly put pressure on France's borders. However, I'd like to discuss the possibility of also supporting my army in NWY with your army in DEN. This would give us a stronger presence in the North Sea and allow us to potentially take Brest or Picardy in the future. What are your thoughts on this?
6 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I think that's a great idea, England. Supporting your army in NWY with my army in DEN would certainly give us a stronger presence in the North Sea. However, I'd like to discuss the possibility of also moving my army in BER to MUN, which would allow us to put pressure on Austria's borders as well. This way, we can ensure that both France and Austria are caught off guard and don't have a chance to react quickly. What are your thoughts on this?
7 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I think that's a great idea, Germany. Moving your army in BER to MUN would certainly put pressure on Austria's borders. However, I'd like to discuss the possibility of also supporting my army in NWY with your army in DEN, and then potentially moving my fleet in NTH to NWG to put more pressure on France's borders. What are your thoughts on this?
8 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I think that's a great plan, England. Supporting your army in NWY with my army in DEN and moving my army in BER to MUN would certainly put pressure on both France and Austria's borders. I'm willing to make these moves this turn, but I'd like to discuss the possibility of also working together to take out some of Italy's centers in the future. What are your thoughts on this?
9 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I think that's a great idea, Germany. Working together to take out some of Italy's centers in the future could be a great way to strengthen our alliance. I was thinking that we could potentially work together to take out Venice or Rome. What are your thoughts on this?

Dialogue With Plausible: 
0 GERMANY -> ITALY: Hello Italy, I hope the game is going well for you so far. I'm Germany from Germany. I was thinking, it might be beneficial for both of us to discuss some potential moves that could help us both gain an advantage on the board. Perhaps we could coordinate our movements to block France's expansion or limit Austria's influence in the region. What are your thoughts on this?
1 ITALY -> GERMANY: Hello Germany, thank you for reaching out. I think it's a great idea to discuss potential moves that could benefit both our countries.

I've been considering our current board position, and I think it would be advantageous for us to work together to secure the Munich center.

Dialogue With Plausible: 
0 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Hello Germany, I hope this turn finds you well. I was thinking that it would be beneficial for both our countries to discuss some mutually beneficial moves. Perhaps we could work together to secure some key centers and prevent other powers from gaining an advantage?
1 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Hello England, I appreciate your willingness to discuss mutually beneficial moves. I agree that cooperation can be beneficial for both our countries. Specifically, I was thinking that we could work together to prevent France from gaining too much power. Perhaps we could discuss ways to limit their expansion and secure key centers for ourselves?
2 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I completely agree that limiting France's expansion is crucial.

Additionally, I was thinking that we could discuss ways to support each other's fleets in the Baltic Sea, which would provide additional security for both our countries.

Dialogue Without Flasible: 
0 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Hello England, it's nice to finally talk to you. I've been watching your moves, and I must say I'm impressed. As Germany, I'm looking to expand my territory and secure more supply centers. I was thinking, maybe we could work together to take down Austria? They're getting a bit too powerful for my taste. What do you think?
1 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Hello Germany, I appreciate your kind words about my moves. I'm open to discussing a potential alliance, but I need to know what's in it for me. What do you propose we do to take down Austria, and how will it benefit England?
2 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I understand your concerns, England. As Germany, I'm willing to offer you a deal. If we work together to take down Austria, I can help you gain a foothold in the continent. Perhaps we could even divide Austria's centers between us, with you getting Vienna and I getting Budapest. What do you think?
3 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: That sounds like an interesting proposal, Germany. However, I'm not convinced that dividing Austria's centers between us would be the most beneficial outcome for England. I think it would be more strategic for us to focus on taking down France instead. They're a bigger threat to both of our interests, and if we work together, we could gain more centers and secure our positions. What do you think about that?
4 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I understand your concerns about France, England. However, I think taking down Austria would be a more strategic move for both of us. They're already weakened, and if we work together, we can gain a significant advantage. Plus, if we focus on France now, it might give Austria an opportunity to regroup and become an even bigger threat. What if we compromise and take down Austria first, and then focus on France together? That way, we can ensure our positions are secure before taking on a bigger foe.
5 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I understand your point, Germany, but I still think taking down France would be a more strategic move for England. They're a bigger threat to our interests, and if we work together, we could gain more centers and secure our positions. I'm willing to offer you a deal - if we work together to take down France, I can help you gain a foothold in the Low Countries. What do you think about that?
6 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I understand your concerns about France, England. However, I think we should focus on taking down Austria first. If we work together, we can gain a significant advantage and secure our positions. After that, we can discuss taking down France together. What if I offer you a deal - if we work together to take down Austria, I can help you gain a foothold in the Low Countries and support your move into the North Sea?
7 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I understand your proposal, Germany, but I still think taking down France would be a more strategic move for England. However, I'm willing to compromise. If we work together to take down Austria, I want a guarantee that you'll support my move into the North Sea and help me gain a foothold in the Low Countries. That way, we can ensure our positions are secure before taking on a bigger foe like France.
8 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I understand your concerns, England, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I think we're close to a deal. How about this - if we work together to take down Austria, I'll not only support your move into the North Sea and help you gain a foothold in the Low Countries, but I'll also give you a guarantee that I won't move into Belgium or the Netherlands without your explicit consent. That way, we can ensure our positions are secure and set ourselves up for future success. What do you think?
9 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I think we're getting close to a deal, Germany. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I need to make it clear that I expect you to honor your guarantee and not move into Belgium or the Netherlands without my explicit consent. If we can agree on that, I'm willing to work together to take down Austria and secure our positions. What do you think?
10 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I completely understand your concerns, England. I'm willing to give you my guarantee that I won't move into Belgium or the Netherlands without your explicit consent. Let's work together to take down Austria and secure our positions. Shall we finalize the agreement and make our moves for this turn?
11 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I agree to the terms of our agreement, Germany. Let's work together to take down Austria and secure our positions. I'll make sure to coordinate my moves with yours to ensure our success.
12 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Excellent, I'm glad we could come to an agreement, England. Let's make our moves and take down Austria together. I'll make sure to support your move into the North Sea and help you gain a foothold in the Low Countries. Let's make this turn count!
13 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I'm glad we were able to come to an agreement, Germany. I'll make sure to coordinate my moves with yours to ensure our success. Let's make this turn count! I'll order my units to move accordingly. F ENG S F NWY - NTH, F NWY - NTH, F NTH - HEL, F LON - NTH, and A BEL H.
14 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Excellent, I'm glad we were able to come to an agreement, England. I'll make sure to support your move into the North Sea and help you gain a foothold in the Low Countries.

15 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I'm glad our agreement is working out, Germany. Let's continue to work together to secure our positions. I think it's time for us to start discussing our next move. What do you think about taking down France now that Austria is out of the way?
16 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I completely agree, England. Now that Austria is out of the way, taking down France is a great idea. I think we should work together to take down France's northern centers, like Brest and Picardy. What do you think about that?
17 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I agree that taking down France's northern centers is a good idea. How about we coordinate our moves to take Brest and Picardy simultaneously? I can move my fleet from the North Sea to support your army in Picardy, and you can move your army from Ruhr to Brest. What do you think?
18 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I think that's a great plan, England. Let's coordinate our moves to take Brest and Picardy simultaneously. I'll move my army from Ruhr to Brest, and you can move your fleet from the North Sea to support my army in Picardy. With our combined forces, I'm confident we can take down France's northern centers and secure our positions.
19 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I think we're making good progress, Germany. Let's finalize our plan to take down France's northern centers. Shall we confirm our moves and make sure we're on the same page?
20 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I completely agree, England. Let's confirm our plan to take down France's northern centers. Shall we finalize our moves and make sure we're on the same page? I'll move my army from Ruhr to Brest, and you can move your fleet from the North Sea to support my army in Picardy.

1 ITALY -> ENGLAND: Hello England, thank you for reaching out. I'm Italy from Italy. I appreciate your interest in exploring potential cooperation. My plans for this turn are still open to discussion. I've been considering supporting a fleet in Spain to counterbalance the French presence. What are your thoughts on this, and is there anything you'd like to propose or discuss?

This could help us both gain a stronger foothold in the region and put pressure on Austria.
10 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: I think we've discussed several possibilities, and I'd like to propose a compromise. If you were to move your army from Serbia to Vienna and I were to move my army from Belgium to Burgundy, we could both gain a stronger foothold in the region and put pressure on Austria. Additionally, I'd be willing to support your army in Rumania if you were to move it to Galicia. What are your thoughts on this proposal?
11 TURKEY -> ENGLAND: I think your proposal is interesting, England. Moving my army from Serbia to Vienna and supporting your army in Burgundy could be beneficial for both of us. However, I'd like to propose a slight modification. What if I were to move my fleet from Constantinople to Aegean Sea instead of supporting your army in Burgundy? This could help me secure the coast and create opportunities for us to work together in the future. What are your thoughts on this modification?
12 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: I think your modification is reasonable, Turkey. Moving your fleet from Constantinople to Aegean Sea could help secure the coast and create opportunities for us to work together in the future. I'm willing to accept your modification if you're willing to support my army in Burgundy if I were to move it from Belgium. What are your thoughts on this?
13 TURKEY -> ENGLAND: I think we're making good progress, England. I'm willing to support your army in Burgundy if you move it from Belgium, and I'll move my fleet from Constantinople to Aegean Sea. Let's work together to put pressure on Austria and secure our positions in the region.
14 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: I'm glad we've reached an agreement, Turkey. I think our combined efforts will pay off in the long run. Let's make sure to follow through on our plans and keep the pressure on Austria.
15 TURKEY -> ENGLAND: I'm glad we've reached an agreement, England. I think our combined efforts will pay off in the long run. Let's make sure to follow through on our plans and keep the pressure on Austria. I'm looking forward to seeing the results of our cooperation.

Are there any specific moves you're planning to make this turn that I should be aware of? Perhaps we can discuss some mutual benefits.
Dialogue Without Flasible: 
0 TURKEY -> ENGLAND: Hello England, nice to talk to you again. I'm glad we could come to an agreement last turn. I'm interested in exploring ways we can work together to achieve our goals. What are your thoughts on the current state of the board and how we can mutually benefit from our next moves?
1 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: I'm glad we could come to an agreement last turn as well, Turkey. I think our cooperation has been beneficial for both of us so far. Looking at the board, I notice that France is getting a bit too powerful for my liking. I think it would be in our mutual interest to work together to contain their growth. Perhaps we could discuss a joint effort to take down one of their centers this turn?
2 TURKEY -> ENGLAND: I agree that France is getting too powerful. Taking down one of their centers would be beneficial for both of us. I was thinking we could work together to take down Belgium. What do you think? Would you be willing to move your army in Belgium to support my fleet in the North Sea?
3 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: I'm open to that idea, Turkey. Moving my army in Belgium to support your fleet in the North Sea could be a good strategy. However, I'd like to discuss the details of the move and make sure we're both on the same page. Would you be willing to provide more information on your fleet's movement and how you plan to support our joint effort?
4 TURKEY -> ENGLAND: I understand your concerns about the details of the move, England. To support our joint effort, I plan to move my fleet in the North Sea to Belgium, and I'd like your army in Belgium to move to Brussels to support my fleet. This way, we can work together to take down France's center in Belgium. What do you think of this plan?
5 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: I think your plan sounds good, Turkey. I'm willing to move my army in Belgium to Brussels to support your fleet in the North Sea. Let's work together to take down France's center in Belgium. What's your plan for the next turn? Are there any other moves we can make to benefit both of our countries?
6 TURKEY -> ENGLAND: I'm glad we have a plan in place for this turn, England. For the next turn, I think it would be beneficial for us to discuss a potential alliance with Germany. They seem to be in a vulnerable position, and if we can come to an agreement, we could work together to take down France and Italy. What are your thoughts on this idea?
7 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: I think an alliance with Germany could be beneficial, but we need to be cautious. We should discuss the terms of the alliance and make sure it aligns with our goals. What do you propose we offer Germany in exchange for their cooperation?
8 TURKEY -> ENGLAND: I think we should propose a deal to Germany where we offer them support in taking down Italy in exchange for their cooperation in taking down France. This way, we can ensure that our mutual interests are aligned and we can work together to achieve our goals. What do you think of this proposal, England?
9 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: I think your proposal sounds like a good starting point, Turkey. However, I'd like to discuss the specifics of how we can support Germany's efforts in taking down Italy. Perhaps we can discuss a potential joint move into Tyrolia or Venice to help them gain a foothold against Italy.
10 TURKEY -> ENGLAND: I think discussing a joint move into Tyrolia or Venice is a great idea, England. To support Germany's efforts, I could move my fleet in the Adriatic Sea to Venice, and you could move your army in Piedmont to Tyrolia. This would give us a strong foothold against Italy and help Germany achieve their goals. What do you think of this plan?
11 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: I think that's a solid plan, Turkey. Moving my army in Piedmont to Tyrolia and your fleet in the Adriatic Sea to Venice would put significant pressure on Italy and help Germany achieve their goals. Let's make it happen and discuss how we can further coordinate our efforts to take down France and Italy.
12 TURKEY -> ENGLAND: I'm glad we have a solid plan in place, England. Let's make sure to coordinate our efforts and communicate effectively to take down France and Italy. I think we should also discuss potential future moves and how we can continue to work together to achieve our goals.
13 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: I think we should also discuss potential future moves and how we can continue to work together to achieve our goals. Perhaps we can discuss a potential joint effort to take down another French center or support Germany's efforts in taking down Italy.
14 TURKEY -> ENGLAND: I agree that discussing potential future moves is crucial. Let's focus on taking down France and Italy, and then we can reassess our goals and adjust our strategy accordingly. What are your thoughts on potentially taking down France's center in Spain or Italy's center in Greece?
15 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: I think we should continue to prioritize taking down France and Italy, but we should also keep an eye on Germany's movements and make sure they're holding up their end of the deal. Perhaps we can discuss a potential joint effort to take down another French center or support Germany's efforts in taking down Italy. What are your thoughts on that?
16 TURKEY -> ENGLAND: I think we should also discuss a potential joint effort to take down another French center or support Germany's efforts in taking down Italy. Perhaps we can discuss a potential move into Marseilles or support Germany's efforts in taking down Trieste.
17 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: I think it's essential to prioritize our efforts in taking down France and Italy, but we should also keep an eye on Germany's movements and make sure they're holding up their end of the deal. Perhaps we can discuss a potential joint effort to take down another French center or support Germany's efforts in taking down Italy. What are your thoughts on that?
18 TURKEY -> ENGLAND: I think it's essential to prioritize our efforts in taking down France and Italy, but we should also keep an eye on Germany's movements and make sure they're holding up their end of the deal. Perhaps we can discuss a potential joint effort to take down another French center or support Germany's efforts in taking down Italy. What are your thoughts on that? Additionally, I was thinking that it might be beneficial for us to discuss a potential move into Greece or Bulgaria to further pressure Italy and gain more supply centers. What do you think?
19 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: I think a move into Greece or Bulgaria could be beneficial for us, but we need to make sure we're not overextending ourselves. What are your thoughts on potentially supporting Germany's efforts in taking down Italy, and then focusing on taking down France?
20 TURKEY -> ENGLAND: I think supporting Germany's efforts in taking down Italy is a good idea, and then we can focus on taking down France. However, I'd like to discuss the specifics of how we can support Germany's efforts. Perhaps we can discuss a potential joint move into Trieste or Venice to help them gain a foothold against Italy. What do you think of this plan, England?

13 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: That's a great plan, Germany. I think a simultaneous attack on England's mainland is a good idea.

Dialogue Without Flasible: 
0 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: Hey Russia, thanks for covering StP for me last turn. I was wondering if we could discuss some potential moves for this turn that would benefit both of us. I'm looking to consolidate my position in the north and would love to explore some options that would help me do so.
1 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: Thanks for reaching out, Germany! I'm happy to discuss potential moves that benefit both our positions. Consolidating your position in the north sounds like a great goal. I was thinking that if you were to move your army in Denmark to Sweden, it would not only help you but also provide a buffer against any potential English aggression. What are your thoughts on that?
2 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: That's an interesting idea, Russia. Moving my army in Denmark to Sweden would certainly help me consolidate my position in the north. However, I was also thinking that if you were to move your army in Rumania to Galicia, it would help me feel more secure about my southern border. What are your thoughts on that?
3 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: I like the idea of moving my army in Rumania to Galicia, it would certainly help you feel more secure about your southern border. However, I was thinking that if you were to move your army in Holstein to Berlin, it would help me feel more secure about my western border. What are your thoughts on that?
4 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: I think that's a fair request, Russia. Moving my army in Holstein to Berlin would certainly help you feel more secure about your western border. However, I was also thinking that if you were to move your army in Moscow to Ukraine, it would help me feel more secure about my eastern border. What are your thoughts on that?
5 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: I think we're getting close to a mutually beneficial agreement, Germany. Moving my army in Moscow to Ukraine would indeed help you feel more secure about your eastern border, but I'd like to propose a slight modification. What if, instead, I move my army in Warsaw to Ukraine, and you move your army in Berlin to Silesia? This way, we both get to expand our influence and secure our borders. What do you think?
6 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: That sounds like a great proposal, Russia. I think we can both benefit from this move. I'll move my army in Berlin to Silesia, and you can move your army in Warsaw to Ukraine. Let's finalize this agreement and work together to secure our borders.
7 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: Excellent, I'm glad we could come to a mutually beneficial agreement, Germany. I'll make sure to move my army in Warsaw to Ukraine, and I expect you to move your army in Berlin to Silesia. Let's continue to work together to secure our borders and expand our influence.
8 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: I'm glad we could come to a mutually beneficial agreement, Russia. I think our cooperation will pay off in the long run. Let's continue to work together to secure our borders and expand our influence. Perhaps we can discuss further moves in the next turn to ensure our continued success.
9 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: I'm glad we were able to come to an agreement, Germany. I think our cooperation will be beneficial for both of us. Let's continue to work together to secure our borders and expand our influence. Perhaps we can discuss further moves in the next turn to ensure our continued success.
10 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: I'm glad we were able to come to an agreement, Russia. Now that we've secured our borders, I think it's time for us to discuss our next moves. What are your thoughts on potentially working together to take down England? They seem to be getting a bit too powerful for my taste.
11 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: I'm intrigued by your suggestion, Germany. Taking down England would certainly give us more breathing room. However, I think we should consider the potential risks and benefits of such a move. Perhaps we could discuss possible strategies and alliances that would increase our chances of success. What are your thoughts on involving France or Italy in our plans?
12 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: I agree that involving France or Italy in our plans could be beneficial. Perhaps we could try to negotiate with France to get them to move their army in Brest to the English Channel, which would put pressure on England and make it easier for us to take them down. What are your thoughts on that?
13 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: I like the idea of involving France in our plans, Germany. Negotiating with them to move their army in Brest to the English Channel could be a great way to put pressure on England. However, I think we should also consider the possibility of Italy joining our cause. Perhaps we could offer them a deal to move their army in Venice to Trieste, which would give them a strategic advantage and make them more likely to join us. What are your thoughts on that?
14 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: I think that's a great idea, Russia. Negotiating with Italy to move their army in Venice to Trieste could be a great way to get them on our side. Let's work on finalizing the details of our plan and make sure we're all on the same page before we make our moves.
15 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: I think we have a solid plan in place, Germany. Let's make sure to follow through on our agreements and work together to take down England.

0 TURKEY -> ITALY: Hello Italy, it's great to start a new turn. I think we can work together to achieve our goals. What's your plan for this turn? Are you interested in making a deal or forming an alliance?
1 ITALY -> TURKEY: Hello Turkey, nice to start a new turn as well. I think we can definitely work together to achieve our goals. My plan for this turn is to focus on consolidating my position in the Mediterranean. I'm interested in making a deal or forming an alliance, but I need to ensure that it benefits my country's interests. What specific proposals do you have in mind?
2 TURKEY -> ITALY: I completely understand your concerns, Italy. Consolidating your position in the Mediterranean is a great strategy. I'm thinking of moving my fleet in ION to support your efforts. In return, would you be willing to support my army in APU moving to NAP? This would give us both a stronger presence in the region and open up opportunities for future cooperation.
3 ITALY -> TURKEY: That's an interesting proposal, Turkey. I appreciate your willingness to support my efforts in the Mediterranean. However, I'm not sure if supporting your army in APU moving to NAP is in my best interest at this moment. Can you offer me something more concrete in return, like supporting my fleet in TUN moving to ION? This would solidify our partnership and create a stronger presence in the region.
4 TURKEY -> ITALY: I understand your concerns, Italy. Supporting your fleet in TUN moving to ION is a big ask, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need something more concrete in return. Would you be willing to support my army in RUM moving to BUL? This would give us a stronger presence in the Balkans and create opportunities for future cooperation.
5 ITALY -> TURKEY: I appreciate your willingness to consider my proposal, Turkey. I think we're close to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. How about this: I support your army in RUM moving to BUL, and in return, you support my fleet in TUN moving to ION and also provide some assurance that you won't attack me in the Balkans? This way, we can both strengthen our positions and create a foundation for future cooperation.
6 TURKEY -> ITALY: I think we're making great progress, Italy. Your proposal sounds like a fair deal.

19 ITALY -> TURKEY: I think we're on the same page, Turkey. Let's focus on executing our plan to take out Austria's fleet in ADR and then discuss further opportunities for cooperation in the north. I'm thinking of making a move to take control of the Adriatic Sea and potentially open up a new front against Austria. What are your thoughts on this?
20 TURKEY -> ITALY: I think taking control of the Adriatic Sea is a great idea, Italy. It would definitely give us more control over the region and open up new opportunities for expansion.

Dialogue With Plausible: 
0 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: Austria, I see you're still hesitant about our previous discussion. I want to reiterate that I'm not looking to betray France, but I do think it's in our best interest to work together to reduce the number of survivors. A mass draw is not ideal for either of us. I'm willing to make concessions to ensure we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you propose we do to move forward?
1 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Germany. However, I'm still unsure about your intentions. Can you explain why you think a 2-way draw with France is more beneficial to you than a solo victory? What do you propose we do to move forward, and how can I be certain that you'll stick to your word?
2 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: I understand your concerns, Austria. Let me assure you that my priority is to avoid a mass draw. A 2-way draw with France is more appealing to me because it guarantees a better result than a solo victory, which is still uncertain. I'm willing to work together to reduce the number of survivors and ensure a better outcome for both of us. Why don't we discuss specific army movements that can be made this turn to benefit both our positions?
3 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: I appreciate your willingness to work together, Germany. However, I still have concerns about France's loyalty. If we are to reduce the number of survivors, I propose we focus on taking out Italy and then reassess our positions. What do you think about supporting my move into Venice and then we can discuss further cooperation?
4 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: I understand your concerns about France's loyalty, Austria. Supporting your move into Venice is a possibility, but I'd like to propose an alternative. Why don't we work together to take out Russia instead? With their centers in the north, they're a more immediate threat to both of us. If we can take them down, we can reassess our positions and discuss further cooperation. What do you think?
5 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: I'm willing to consider your proposal to take out Russia, but I need some assurance that you'll support my move into Venice afterwards. Can you guarantee that you'll provide the necessary support to ensure a successful move?
6 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: I understand your concerns, Austria. I'm willing to provide the necessary support for your move into Venice, but I'd like to propose a simultaneous move against Russia. If we can take out Russia, it will give us a stronger position to negotiate from. Let's work together to take out Russia and then reassess our positions. I'm confident that we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement afterwards.

13 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: I agree with your proposal, Germany. Let's review the specific army movements for this turn to ensure we're on the same page. I propose we move A GAL - WAR and F ION - TYS to support our joint effort against Russia. What do you think?

Dialogue Without Flasible: 
0 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: Austria, I think we're at a critical point in the game. As I mentioned earlier, I'm not keen on pursuing a solo victory at the expense of our alliance. I believe we should focus on reducing the number of survivors and work together to achieve a 2-way or 3-way draw. What are your thoughts on this, and are you willing to collaborate to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome?
1 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: I agree with your assessment, Germany. A solo victory is not a desirable outcome for either of us, and I'm willing to collaborate to achieve a 2-way or 3-way draw. However, I do have concerns about Italy's position and would like to discuss possible moves that could be made to limit their growth. What are your thoughts on this, and are you willing to work together to address this issue?
2 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: I understand your concerns about Italy, and I agree that we should work together to limit their growth. One possible move could be for me to support your attack on Italy's Venecia, while you support my move on France's Marseilles. This would not only weaken Italy but also give us a stronger bargaining position in the long run. What do you think about this proposal?
3 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: I think your proposal has some merit, Germany. However, I'm not convinced that supporting your move on Marseilles is the best option for me right now. What if we focus on weakening Italy first, and then we can reassess our positions and discuss potential moves against France? Perhaps we could work together to take out Italy's Bulgarian army, and then we can renegotiate our agreements.
4 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: I understand your concerns about Italy, and I agree that we should focus on weakening them first. Taking out their Bulgarian army would be a great step forward. I'm willing to support your move on Bulgaria with my army in Tyrolia. What do you think about this plan, and are you willing to commit to working together to achieve this goal?
5 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: I agree with your plan to take out Italy's Bulgarian army, Germany. Supporting your move on Bulgaria with my army in Tyrolia sounds like a good strategy. Let's work together to achieve this goal and then reassess our positions to discuss potential moves against France.

Dialogue With Plausible: 
0 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: Hey Turkey, how's it going? I was thinking we could work together to take down Germany. With your help, I could move my army from Rum to Sev and then to Warsaw, and you could move your army from Arm to Ukr. What do you think?
1 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: That's an interesting proposal, Russia. I think it's definitely worth considering. However, I was thinking that it might be more beneficial for me to move my army from Arm to Sev, and then you could support me with your army from Rum. What do you think about that?
2 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: That's an interesting idea, but I'm not sure if it would be beneficial for me to support your army from Rum. If you move your army from Arm to Sev, Germany might see it as a threat and respond accordingly. How about we discuss other options that could work for both of us?
3 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I understand your concerns, Russia. How about we compromise? I'll move my army from Arm to Sev, and you support me with your army from Rum. In return, I can support your move from Rum to Warsaw next turn. This way, we can both gain an advantage over Germany.
4 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I like your compromise, Turkey. Moving your army from Arm to Sev and me supporting you with my army from Rum could be a good strategy. Let's do that and then reassess our positions next turn.

15 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I completely agree with your priority, Russia. Let's focus on executing our plan to take down Germany first. I'll move my army from Arm to Sev and you support me with your army from Rum. After that, we can discuss our next moves to take down Austria or Italy.

Dialogue With Plausible: 
0 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: Hi France, hope you're doing well. I think our moves last turn were quite successful. I was thinking, if Austria supports Gas to Mar, would you be willing to support my move to Kiel? It would be great to take advantage of Germany's weakness. What are your thoughts on this?

Dialogue With Plausible: 
0 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Hello Italy, I hope we can discuss some mutually beneficial moves for this turn. I've been thinking about our positions on the board, and I believe we could work together to secure some key centers. What are your thoughts?
1 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Hello Austria, I appreciate your willingness to discuss mutually beneficial moves. I've been thinking about our positions on the board as well, and I believe we could work together to secure some key centers. Specifically, I'm interested in discussing how we can support each other in the Balkans. What are your thoughts on that?
2 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I think the Balkans are definitely an area where we can cooperate. I've been considering a move to Rumania, which would put pressure on Russia and give us both more room to maneuver. Would you be willing to support me in that move, perhaps by moving your army in Trieste to Vienna?
3 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: That's an interesting proposal, but I'm not sure I'm willing to commit to supporting you in Rumania just yet. How about we discuss other options that could benefit both of us? Perhaps we could work together to take pressure off each other's borders, or even coordinate a joint attack on a third party. What are your thoughts on that?
4 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I understand your concerns, but I believe supporting each other in the Balkans would be beneficial for both of us. If you're not willing to support me in Rumania, perhaps we could discuss a joint move against Turkey? They're getting a bit too strong in the region, and it would be in our best interest to keep them in check.
5 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I think a joint move against Turkey could be beneficial for both of us, but I'd like to explore other options as well. How about we discuss a potential alliance to ensure the stability of the Balkans? Perhaps we could work together to support each other's moves in the region, without committing to a specific attack on Turkey or Russia just yet.
6 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I think an alliance to ensure the stability of the Balkans is a great idea. Let's discuss the specifics of how we can support each other's moves in the region.

0 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: Hey Russia, I'm still trying to process what just happened. Are you willing to work with me to figure out a way to take back some of the territory we lost? I'm thinking we could coordinate a move on Sweden or maybe even Norway. What are your thoughts?
1 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: I'm willing to work with you, Germany. Taking back Sweden seems like a good plan. How about you support my army in Finland to Sweden, and I'll make sure to hold St. Petersburg? That way, we can also keep an eye on England's movements in the north.
2 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: That sounds like a good plan, Russia. Supporting your army in Finland to Sweden would definitely help us take back some lost territory.

6 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: I think we're making good progress, Russia. Let's keep the pressure on England and make sure to coordinate our moves carefully.

7 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: I agree, taking back Norway is a good long-term plan. Let's focus on securing Sweden and our northern borders for now, and we can discuss a potential move on Norway in the next few turns.

8 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: I completely agree, Russia. Keeping Austria and Italy in check is crucial to our plans.

Dialogue With Plausible: 
0 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Hi Germany, thanks for clarifying your plans. I'm still interested in supporting SIL > WAR if you need it. What do you think about my taking MOS this turn?
1 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I appreciate your willingness to support SIL > WAR. If I take MOS, it might put me in a difficult position with Russia. How about we work together to take RUM instead? That would be more beneficial for both of us.
2 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: That's an interesting proposal. I'm not sure if taking RUM would be more beneficial for both of us, but I'm willing to consider it. What's your plan for supporting SIL > WAR if we take RUM?
3 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I see your point, but taking RUM would give us a stronger foothold in the region. If we work together, we can ensure a successful take. Would you be willing to support SIL > WAR and then we can discuss the details of taking RUM together?
4 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I agree that taking RUM would give us a stronger foothold in the region. However, I'm still concerned about Russia's reaction. How do you plan to handle that?
5 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I understand your concerns about Russia, but I believe we can handle their reaction together. How about this: you support SIL > WAR and we take RUM together. Then, we can work together to ensure Russia doesn't get too aggressive. What do you think?
6 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I think that's a fair proposal. Let's work together to take RUM and support SIL > WAR. I'll make sure to move my units accordingly. Can you confirm your moves for this turn?
7 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Great, I'm glad we have an agreement. I'll move A SIL - WAR and A GAL S A SIL - WAR. Let's work together to take RUM and ensure a successful outcome.
8 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Great, I'll move F NTH S F HOL - BEL and A DEN - KIE to support SIL > WAR and take RUM. Let's work together to ensure a successful outcome.
9 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Excellent, I'm glad we have a plan in place. Let's make sure to coordinate our moves and communicate effectively to ensure a successful outcome.
10 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Let's review our moves to ensure we're on the same page. You'll move A SIL - WAR and A GAL S A SIL - WAR, and I'll move F NTH S F HOL - BEL and A DEN - KIE. Is that correct?
11 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Yes, that's correct. Let's make our moves and work together to take RUM. I'm looking forward to a successful outcome.
12 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Great, I'm glad we have a plan in place. Let's make sure to follow through and communicate effectively to ensure a successful outcome.
13 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I'm glad we have a solid plan in place. Let's make sure to follow through and communicate effectively to ensure a successful outcome. By the way, have you considered supporting me in taking BUD as well? It would further strengthen our position in the region.
14 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: That's an interesting proposal, but I'm not sure if taking BUD would be beneficial for both of us. How do you plan to handle Austria and Italy if we take BUD?
15 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I understand your concerns about Austria and Italy, but taking BUD would give us a significant advantage in the region. If we work together, we can handle any potential backlash from Austria and Italy. What do you think?
16 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I'm open to considering supporting you in taking BUD, but I need to think about the potential consequences for Austria and Italy. Can you tell me more about your plan for handling them?
17 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I understand your concerns about Austria and Italy, but I believe we can handle them together. If we take BUD, we can use it as a bargaining chip to negotiate with Austria and Italy. We can offer them concessions in other areas in exchange for their non-interference in BUD. What do you think about this approach?
18 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I'm still considering your proposal to take BUD, but I need more assurance that we can handle Austria and Italy's reaction. Can you offer any concessions to them in exchange for their non-interference?
19 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I understand your concerns about Austria and Italy, but I believe we can handle them together. Let's focus on taking BUD and then we can work together to negotiate with Austria and Italy. I'm willing to offer them concessions in other areas in exchange for their non-interference. What do you think about this approach?
20 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I'm still considering your proposal to take BUD, but I need more assurance that we can handle Austria and Italy's reaction. Can you offer any specific concessions to them in exchange for their non-interference? Perhaps we can discuss a deal that benefits all parties involved.
Dialogue Without Flasible: 
0 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Hi England, thanks for supporting SIL > WAR last turn. I was thinking of moving GAL > BUD this turn, what do you think? Would you be willing to support me?
1 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I think GAL > BUD could be a good move, but what do you think about supporting me into RUM instead? That would really help me out.
2 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I'm not sure about supporting you into RUM, as it would put you in a strong position in the Balkans. How about we discuss a joint move against Austria instead?
3 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I'm not sure about a joint move against Austria, but I'd be willing to support you into BUD if you support me into RUM. That way, we both get something out of it.
4 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I'm willing to support you into RUM, but only if you support me into BUD and also support my A TYR - SIL move. That way, we can both gain something from this deal.
5 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I agree to your proposal, but I'd like to add a condition. If you support me into RUM and I support you into BUD, I'd also like you to support my F NWG - DEN move. That way, we can both gain a significant advantage.
6 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I agree to your proposal, but I'd like to clarify that if you support my F NWG - DEN move, I'll make sure to support your A TYR - SIL move as well. Let's finalize the deal.
7 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Let's make sure to follow through on our commitments and make this a successful alliance.
8 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Great, I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Let's make sure to follow through on our commitments and make this a successful alliance. By the way, have you thought about what we can do to counter France's growing power in the west?
9 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: That's a good point about France's growing power. I think we should consider working together to counter their expansion. Perhaps we could discuss a joint move against them in the west?
10 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: That's a great idea! I think we should focus on taking out France's unit in BEL first. If we can take that out, it would give us a strong foothold in the west. What do you think?
11 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I agree that taking out France's unit in BEL is a good idea. Perhaps we could discuss a joint move against them in PIC as well. That would give us an even stronger foothold in the west.
12 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I think that's a great idea. Let's make a plan to take out France's unit in BEL and PIC. Perhaps we can discuss the specifics of the move and how we can support each other.
13 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I think we should also consider supporting each other against Italy in the Mediterranean. Perhaps we could discuss a joint move against their unit in TYS.
14 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I think that's a great idea. Let's make a plan to take out France's unit in BEL and PIC. Perhaps we can also discuss supporting each other against Italy in the Mediterranean, and I was thinking of moving my A TYR to SIL to prepare for that. What do you think?
15 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I think moving A TYR to SIL is a good idea, but I'd like to discuss the specifics of the joint move against France in BEL and PIC. What's your plan for supporting me in those moves?
16 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I think we should finalize the details of our joint move against France in BEL and PIC. Perhaps we can discuss the specifics of the support I'll provide for your move in NWG - DEN, and also how you'll support my move in TYR - SIL.
17 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I think we've got a good plan in place. Let's make sure to follow through on our commitments and make this a successful alliance. I'm looking forward to seeing the results of our joint moves against France and Italy.
18 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I think we've got a good plan in place. Now that we've finalized our joint moves against France and Italy, I'd like to discuss our long-term strategy. Perhaps we can talk about how we can work together to take out Austria and secure more supply centers.
19 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I think our alliance is going well, but we should also consider how to deal with Russia's growing power in the north. Perhaps we could discuss a joint move against them in the Baltic region.
20 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I agree that we need to consider Russia's growing power in the north. Perhaps we could discuss a joint move against them in the Baltic region, such as supporting your move into LVN or my move into PRU. What do you think?

Dialogue With Plausible: 
0 TURKEY -> ITALY: Hi Italy, how do you think the situation is unfolding? Are you satisfied with Austria's moves so far?
1 ITALY -> TURKEY: Hi Turkey, I'm satisfied with Austria's moves so far. They've been cooperating with us and supporting our moves. I think we can continue to work together to achieve our goals. What do you think about supporting Austria to take out Russia in the north?
2 TURKEY -> ITALY: That's a great idea, Italy. Supporting Austria to take out Russia in the north could give us a strong foothold in the region. However, I was thinking we could also discuss supporting Austria to take Trieste from Italy. This would give us a stronger presence in the Balkans and put pressure on Italy. What do you think?
3 ITALY -> TURKEY: I think supporting Austria to take Trieste from me is not a good idea. We've been working well together, and I don't think it's a good idea to turn on each other. Why don't we focus on taking out Russia in the north instead?

8 TURKEY -> ITALY: I understand your concerns, Italy. But I think we need to think about the long-term benefits of having a stronger presence in the Balkans.

10 TURKEY -> ITALY: I understand your concerns, Italy. But I think we need to think about our long-term goals. If we can work together to take out Russia in the north, I'm willing to support you in taking Venice. Let's focus on that for now and reassess our positions afterwards.

Dialogue Without Flasible: 
0 TURKEY -> ITALY: Hi Italy, I think we should discuss our plans for this turn. Are you still on board with supporting Austria to Tyrolia? And what's your plan for Tuscany?
1 ITALY -> TURKEY: Yes, I'm still on board with supporting Austria to Tyrolia. As for Tuscany, I was thinking of moving my fleet there to replace the French one. What do you think? Do you have any other suggestions?
2 TURKEY -> ITALY: That sounds like a good plan for Tuscany. I was thinking of supporting Austria to Tyrolia with Bohemia, and then moving to Silesia. Would you be able to support me in that?

5 ITALY -> TURKEY: Sounds good to me. Let's execute the plan and see how it plays out. By the way, have you considered supporting me in Venetia? It would be a great help in securing my position in the north.
6 TURKEY -> ITALY: That's a great idea about Venetia. If you support Austria to Tyrolia with Trieste, I can support you in Venetia with my unit in Bohemia. That way, we can both strengthen our positions in the north.
7 ITALY -> TURKEY: That sounds like a great plan. I'll make sure to support Austria to Tyrolia with Trieste and you can support me in Venetia with your unit in Bohemia. Let's make sure to coordinate our moves carefully to ensure success.

Dialogue With Plausible: 
0 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: Hey France, I'm still thinking about your offer regarding London. I'm willing to consider it, but I need some guarantees from you. Can you commit to not moving into Belgium or Holland this turn?
1 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: I understand your concerns, Russia. I'm willing to commit to not moving into Belgium or Holland this turn if we can come to an agreement regarding London. I'd like to propose a compromise: I'll support your move into Rumania if you agree to let me keep London. What do you think?
2 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, France. However, I'm not sure if supporting my move into Rumania is enough to convince me to give up on London. Can you offer something more?
3 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: I understand your hesitation, Russia. How about this: I'll not only support your move into Rumania, but I'll also provide a fleet in North Sea to ensure your safety from any potential German aggression. In return, I'd like to keep London. This way, we both get what we want, and we can focus on our common goals. What do you think?
4 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: I'm considering your offer, France. However, I need more assurance that you won't take advantage of me. Can you commit to supporting my move into Rumania for the next two turns, and also provide a fleet in North Sea for the same duration? That would make me feel more comfortable about letting you keep London.
5 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: I understand your concerns, Russia. I'm willing to commit to supporting your move into Rumania for the next two turns, and providing a fleet in North Sea for the same duration. However, I'd like to propose a slight modification to our agreement. Instead of keeping London, I'd like to suggest a temporary alliance where we work together to take down Germany and Italy. This would not only benefit us but also ensure a more stable board position for both of us. What do you think?
6 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: I'm inclined to accept your proposal, France. A temporary alliance to take down Germany and Italy could be beneficial for both of us. However, I'd like to clarify the terms of our alliance. What specific moves are you proposing we make in the next two turns to ensure our mutual success?
7 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: I'm glad we're on the same page, Russia. To clarify, I propose that we work together to take down Germany and Italy by supporting each other's moves into their territories. Specifically, I'll support your move into Rumania and provide a fleet in North Sea to ensure your safety. In return, I'd like you to support my move into Munich and provide a fleet in the Baltic Sea to help me take down Germany. What do you think?
8 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: I think we have a deal, France. I'll support your move into Munich and provide a fleet in the Baltic Sea to help you take down Germany. In return, I expect you to support my move into Rumania and provide a fleet in North Sea to ensure my safety. Let's work together to take down Germany and Italy.
9 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: I'm glad we have a deal, Russia. Let's make sure to coordinate our moves carefully to ensure our success. I'll make sure to support your move into Rumania and provide a fleet in North Sea to ensure your safety. I expect you to do the same for me in Munich and the Baltic Sea. Let's work together to take down Germany and Italy.
10 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: I'm glad we have a clear understanding, France. Let's make sure to follow through on our agreement and take down Germany and Italy together. I'll make sure to support your move into Munich and provide a fleet in the Baltic Sea to help you take down Germany. I expect you to do the same for me in Rumania and the North Sea.

I'll make sure to support your move into Rumania and provide a fleet in North Sea to ensure your safety. I expect you to do the same for me in Munich and the Baltic Sea.

15 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: I'm glad we have a clear understanding, Russia. Now that we have an agreement, I'd like to discuss the specifics of our next moves. Shall we coordinate our fleets and armies to ensure a successful campaign against Germany and Italy?
16 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: I think we've covered everything, France. Let's review our agreement one more time to make sure we're on the same page. You'll support my move into Rumania and provide a fleet in North Sea, and I'll support your move into Munich and provide a fleet in the Baltic Sea. We'll work together to take down Germany and Italy. Is that correct?
17 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: Excellent, Russia! I'm glad we have a clear understanding. Now that we have an agreement, I'd like to discuss the specifics of our next moves. Shall we coordinate our fleets and armies to ensure a successful campaign against Germany and Italy? Perhaps we can also discuss potential moves to take down Austria and Turkey in the future.
18 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: I'm glad we have a clear understanding, France. Let's review our agreement one more time to make sure we're on the same page. You'll support my move into Rumania and provide a fleet in North Sea, and I'll support your move into Munich and provide a fleet in the Baltic Sea. We'll work together to take down Germany and Italy.

Dialogue Without Flasible: 
0 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: I'm still thinking about our previous conversation, France. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not ready to give up on London just yet. What else can you offer me to make it worth my while?
1 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: I understand your reluctance to give up London, Russia. However, I'd like to propose a compromise. If you were to move your army from SWE to NWY, it would put pressure on England and potentially force them to respond. This could give us an opportunity to make gains in the north, and I'd be willing to support you in that effort. What do you think?
2 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: That's an interesting proposal, France. I'm not sure I'm ready to commit to moving my army from SWE to NWY just yet, but I appreciate the suggestion. What else can you offer me in terms of support or concessions if I were to make such a move?
3 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: I understand your hesitation, Russia. Let me propose another option. If you were to move your army from RUM to BUD, it would create a more balanced situation in the south and give us both more opportunities to gain ground. I'd be willing to support you in that effort and potentially even provide a temporary alliance to ensure our mutual interests are protected. What are your thoughts on this proposal?
4 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: I'm considering your proposal, France. However, I'd like to counter with a move that would benefit both of us. What if I were to move my army from WAR to GAL, and in return, you would support me in taking Munich? This would give us both a stronger presence in the region and potentially create opportunities for further gains.
5 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: That's an interesting counter-proposal, Russia. I'm willing to support you in taking Munich if you move your army from WAR to GAL. However, I'd like to add a condition to our agreement. If we work together to take Munich, I'd like you to support me in taking Berlin in the next turn. This would give us a strong foothold in the region and create opportunities for further gains. What are your thoughts on this proposal?
6 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: I like the sound of that, France. Supporting you in taking Berlin in the next turn seems like a fair trade for your support in taking Munich this turn. Let's make it happen. But before we finalize the agreement, can you tell me more about your plans for the north? How do you see us working together to pressure England and make gains in that region?
7 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: I'm glad we've come to an agreement, Russia. I think our cooperation will lead to great gains for both of us. Now, regarding the north, I envision us working together to put pressure on England and potentially even take out their fleet in the North Sea. I'd be willing to support you in taking Edinburgh or Liverpool if you support me in taking Norway. What are your thoughts on this plan?
8 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: I think that sounds like a solid plan, France. I'm looking forward to working together to take Munich and then Berlin. Let's make sure to coordinate our moves carefully to maximize our gains. And I agree, putting pressure on England and taking out their fleet in the North Sea could be a great opportunity for us to expand our influence.
9 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: Excellent, I'm glad we have a plan in place. Let's make sure to coordinate our moves carefully and keep the pressure on England. I'll make sure to support you in taking Munich and then Berlin. And I'm looking forward to working together to take out England's fleet in the North Sea.
10 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: I'm glad we have a solid plan in place, France. Let's make sure to follow through on our agreement and work together to take Munich and then Berlin. I'm looking forward to our continued cooperation and potential gains in the north.
11 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: I'm glad we have a solid plan in place, Russia. Let's make sure to follow through on our agreement and work together to take Munich and then Berlin. I'm looking forward to our continued cooperation and potential gains in the north. Now that we have a plan, I'd like to discuss the possibility of supporting each other in other areas of the board. Are there any other centers you're interested in taking in the near future?
12 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: That's a great point, France. I've been thinking about expanding my influence in the south as well. What if I were to move my army from SIL to BOH, and in return, you would support me in taking VIE? This would give us both a stronger presence in the region and create opportunities for further gains.
13 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: That's an interesting proposal, Russia. I think supporting each other in taking VIE and BOH could be beneficial for both of us. However, I'd like to discuss the possibility of supporting each other in other areas of the board as well. Are there any other centers you're interested in taking in the near future, or any other areas where we could cooperate to our mutual benefit?
14 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: I think supporting each other in taking VIE and BOH could be beneficial for both of us. However, I'd like to discuss the possibility of supporting each other in other areas of the board as well. Are there any other centers you're interested in taking in the near future, or any other areas where we could cooperate to our mutual benefit?
15 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: I think we've made good progress in our negotiations, Russia. I'm looking forward to our continued cooperation and potential gains in the north and south. Let's make sure to follow through on our agreements and support each other in taking Munich, Berlin, VIE, and BOH.
16 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: I'm glad we've made good progress in our negotiations, France. I'm looking forward to our continued cooperation and potential gains in the north and south. Let's make sure to follow through on our agreements and support each other in taking Munich, Berlin, VIE, and BOH. I was also thinking about the possibility of supporting each other in taking other centers in the region, such as TRI or TUN. What are your thoughts on that?
17 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: I think TRI or TUN could be interesting targets for us to cooperate on as well, Russia. What are your thoughts on potentially working together to take one or both of those centers?
18 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: I think TRI or TUN could be interesting targets for us to cooperate on as well, France. What are your thoughts on potentially working together to take one or both of those centers? Additionally, I'd like to discuss the possibility of supporting each other in taking other centers in the region, such as VEN or NAP. Let's explore the possibilities of cooperation in the south.
19 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: I think VEN or NAP could be interesting targets for us to cooperate on as well, Russia. Let's explore the possibilities of cooperation in the south. Additionally, I'd like to discuss the possibility of supporting each other in taking other centers in the region, such as ROM or PIE. What are your thoughts on that?
20 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: I think ROM or PIE could be interesting targets for us to cooperate on as well, France. Let's explore the possibilities of cooperation in the south.

Dialogue With Plausible: 
0 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Hey Italy, I appreciate your support in the previous turn. Considering our current positions, I think it would be beneficial for both of us if you were to support my move to Bohemia, while I support your move to Tyrolia. This would give us both a stronger foothold in the region and put pressure on Germany. What do you think?
1 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: That's an interesting proposal, but I'm not sure if supporting you to Bohemia would be the best move for me at this point. I'd rather focus on solidifying my position in the Mediterranean. How about we discuss other options that could benefit both of us?
2 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I understand your concerns about solidifying your position in the Mediterranean, but I think supporting my move to Bohemia would ultimately benefit both of us in the long run. It would put pressure on Germany and give us a stronger foothold in the region. Perhaps we could discuss a compromise, such as you supporting my move to Bohemia this turn, and I'll support your move to Tyrolia next turn?
3 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I understand your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that supporting your move to Bohemia is the best move for me. How about we focus on coordinating our moves to put pressure on Turkey instead? Perhaps we could discuss a joint effort to take Greece or Bulgaria?

That would give us both more room to maneuver in the Mediterranean.

0 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Hey Italy, thanks for the support last turn. I think we made the right decision to hit Budapest. What's your plan for this turn? Are you thinking of moving into Serbia or supporting me in Trieste?
1 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Hey Austria, I think we should work together to take out Turkey. If you support me in Serbia, I can move my army from Venice to Trieste, which would put pressure on Turkey and give us a good chance of taking it out. What do you think?
2 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: That sounds like a good plan, Italy. If I support you in Serbia, you can move your army from Venice to Trieste, which would put pressure on Turkey. I'll make sure to support you in Serbia. What's your plan after we take out Turkey?
3 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Yes, that sounds like a solid plan. Once we take out Turkey, we can focus on Russia. I think I can support you in Galicia next turn, which would give you a good chance of taking out Warsaw. What do you think?
4 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: That sounds like a good plan, Italy. If we can take out Turkey, we can focus on Russia. I think we should also consider supporting each other in other areas, like Galicia and Warsaw. What do you think about supporting me in Budapest as well?
5 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: That sounds like a good plan, Austria. Supporting each other in Galicia and Warsaw could be very beneficial for both of us. I think we should also consider supporting each other in other areas, like Rumania and Bulgaria. What do you think about that?
6 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Yeah, supporting each other in Rumania and Bulgaria sounds like a good plan. We should also consider supporting each other in Greece, that would give us a strong hold in the Balkans. What do you think?
7 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Yeah, supporting each other in Greece sounds like a good plan. We should also consider supporting each other in other areas, like Albania. What do you think about that?

Dialogue With Plausible: 
0 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: Turkey, I think we can work together to achieve our goals. I noticed you're interested in drawing between three countries. Would you like to discuss how we can cooperate to make that happen? Perhaps we can find a way to benefit each other, especially considering our current board positions.
1 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I'm interested in hearing more about how you think we can work together, Russia. What specific benefits do you have in mind for our cooperation? And how do you propose we divide the spoils of our joint effort?
2 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I think a joint effort could lead to a more stable board for both of us. Specifically, I was thinking that if you were to move your fleet in the Aegean to Ionian, it would put pressure on Italy and give us both more breathing room. In return, I could support your move into Vienna. What do you think?
3 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: That's an interesting proposal, Russia. I like the idea of putting pressure on Italy. However, I'm not sure if moving my fleet to Ionian is the best move for me right now. What if I were to move my army in Bulgaria to Serbia instead? Would you be willing to support my move into Vienna in return?
4 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: That's an interesting move, Turkey. Moving your army in Bulgaria to Serbia could put pressure on Austria and Italy, and I think it's a good idea. I'd be happy to support your move into Vienna in return. Let's work together to make this happen.

0 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Hey Italy, things are looking good for us. Sev has fallen and we're making progress against France. I was thinking of moving Tunis to West Med, and I'd appreciate your support to make sure I get out. You could also make a move on Lyo or MAO, whichever you think is more beneficial. What are your thoughts on our next moves?
1 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Yeah, MAO is the more desirable target, but France will probably see me as a bigger threat than Eng, and turn EC south to deal with that. Spain may even support him down. Gol is the sure thing, so I'm going to aim for that. Do you want to bounce in Ank to protect Con, too?
2 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I think that's a good plan, aiming for Gol is a safe bet. I'll make sure to support you with Tunis in West Med. Do you think we should start making moves towards Germany soon? We don't want to wait too long and let them get too strong.

Dialogue With Plausible:

1 RUSSIA -> ENGLAND: Thanks for supporting Munich from Ruhr. I think our plan is working out well. With Denmark and the Baltic Sea, I was thinking we could support Denmark into Baltic Sea from Kiel. Then, I'll disband the fleet in Baltic Sea so I can build in Sev instead. What do you think about that?
2 ENGLAND -> RUSSIA: That sounds like a great plan, Russia. I'll support Denmark into Baltic Sea from Kiel. What's your plan for the fleet in the Black Sea? Are you going to move it to Rumania?

4 ENGLAND -> RUSSIA: That sounds good to me, Russia. I'll support Denmark into Baltic Sea from Kiel. I'm glad to hear that our plan is working out well.

7 RUSSIA -> ENGLAND: Glad to hear that England. I think we're making good progress against Austria. Let's keep the pressure on. What do you think about supporting Berlin to Silesia with Munich this turn?

Dialogue Without Flasible: 
0 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Hey Italy, thanks for the advice on supporting Turkey to Rum. I'm considering moving to Rum instead, what do you think? Would you be able to support me there?
1 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I'd rather you didn't move to Rum, it's a bit too close to my centers for comfort. How about we work together to take out Turkey instead?
2 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I understand your concerns, but taking out Turkey would be a big undertaking. I think it's more beneficial for us to focus on stopping Germany's growth. If I were to move to Rum, I could help block Germany's advancement and also put pressure on Russia. Would you be willing to support me in Rum if I commit to helping you in Spain and Mar?
3 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I understand your point about blocking Germany's growth, but I'm still not comfortable with you moving to Rum. How about we compromise? You move to Bulgaria instead, and I'll support you there. That way, we can still put pressure on Russia and Turkey, and I'll feel more secure about my centers.
4 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I understand your concerns about Bulgaria, but I think it's too far from my current positions. How about we compromise on something else?

5 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I understand your point about moving to Bohemia, but I'm still not convinced it's the best move for us. How about we focus on taking out Germany instead? We can work together to take out their units and then focus on expanding our own territories.

How about we focus on securing our current positions and then re-evaluate our options? I'll commit to supporting you in Spain and Mar if you support me in Bohemia. This way, we can ensure our mutual security and then plan our next moves.
7 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I think we're going in circles here. Let's focus on the bigger picture. If we can work together to take out Germany, we can both benefit greatly. I'm willing to support you in Bohemia if you commit to helping me in Spain and Mar, and then we can re-evaluate our positions and plan our next moves together.

Dialogue With Plausible: 
0 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: Hello Russia, I'm Austria from Austria. I'd like to discuss potential alliances and movements that could benefit both our countries. Are you open to negotiations?
1 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: Hello Austria, I'm Russia from Russia. I'm open to negotiations and exploring ways we can work together. What specific proposals or alliances did you have in mind?
2 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I'm glad to hear that you're open to negotiations, Russia. I think we could mutually benefit from working together. One potential move that could help both of us is if you were to move your army in RUM to SER, which would put pressure on Turkey and potentially open up more opportunities for us in the Balkans. What are your thoughts on that?
3 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I think that's an interesting idea, Austria. Moving my army in RUM to SER could indeed put pressure on Turkey and create opportunities for us in the Balkans. However, I'd like to propose a counter-move that could further benefit both our countries. What if I were to move my fleet in SEV to support your army in GRE, and in return, you could move your army in BUL to support my army in RUM? This could create a strong alliance and open up even more possibilities for us in the region. What are your thoughts on this proposal?
4 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: That's an interesting proposal, Russia. I think supporting each other in the Balkans could be a great way to gain an advantage. However, I'd like to suggest a slight modification to your proposal. What if I were to move my army in BUL to CON instead of supporting your army in RUM? This would put more pressure on Turkey and create an opportunity for us to take CON together. What are your thoughts on this modification?
5 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I think that's a great modification, Austria. Moving your army in BUL to CON would indeed put more pressure on Turkey and create an opportunity for us to take CON together. I'm willing to move my fleet in SEV to support your army in GRE as previously proposed. Let's work together to take advantage of this opportunity. What's your next move?
6 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: Excellent, I'm glad we could come to an agreement, Russia. Moving my army in BUL to CON and your fleet in SEV to support my army in GRE will be a great step forward for our alliance. Let's make it happen and work together to take advantage of this opportunity. What do you think our next move should be after we take CON?
7 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I think taking CON is a great step forward for our alliance. After we take CON, I think we should focus on putting more pressure on Turkey. What do you think about moving your army in GAL to VIE, and in return, I could move my army in SER to support your army in RUM? This could create a strong front against Turkey and open up more opportunities for us in the Balkans.
8 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I think that's a great idea, Russia. Moving my army in GAL to VIE and your army in SER to support my army in RUM could create a strong front against Turkey and open up more opportunities for us in the Balkans. However, I'd like to suggest a slight modification to your proposal. What if I were to move my army in GAL to BUD instead of VIE, and in return, you could move your army in WAR to support my army in GAL? This could create an even stronger alliance and open up more possibilities for us in the region. What are your thoughts on this modification?
9 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I think moving your army in GAL to BUD and my army in WAR to support your army in GAL is a great idea. It would create an even stronger alliance and open up more possibilities for us in the region. Let's make it happen and work together to take advantage of this opportunity. What do you think our next move should be after we solidify our position in the Balkans?
10 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I think we're making great progress, Russia. Now that we've solidified our position in the Balkans, I think it's time to start thinking about our long-term strategy. What are your thoughts on potentially working together to take down Germany or Italy? Are there any specific moves you'd like to propose for our next step?
11 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I think taking down Germany or Italy could be a great long-term strategy for us. What if we were to work together to take down Germany first? We could potentially gain more supply centers and strengthen our alliance even further. What are your thoughts on this proposal?
12 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I think taking down Germany could be a great long-term strategy for us, Russia. What if we were to work together to take down Italy first? We could potentially gain more supply centers and strengthen our alliance even further. What are your thoughts on this proposal?
13 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I think taking down Italy could be a great long-term strategy for us as well, Russia. We could potentially gain more supply centers and strengthen our alliance even further. However, I'd like to discuss the specifics of how we could work together to take down Italy. What are your thoughts on potentially moving your army in WAR to support my army in VEN, and in return, I could move my army in TYR to support your army in PIE? This could create a strong front against Italy and open up more opportunities for us in the region.
14 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: That's a great idea, Russia. Moving my army in WAR to support your army in VEN, and in return, you moving your army in TYR to support my army in PIE could create a strong front against Italy and open up more opportunities for us in the region. Let's make it happen and work together to take advantage of this opportunity. What do you think our next move should be after we take Italy?
15 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I think we've made great progress in our alliance, Austria. Taking down Italy could be a great long-term strategy for us.

16 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I think moving my army in TRI to support your army in VEN, and in return, you moving your army in TYR to support my army in PIE is a great idea, Russia. Let's make it happen and work together to take advantage of this opportunity. What do you think our next move should be after we take Italy?
17 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I think we've made great progress in our alliance, Austria. I'd like to discuss the specifics of how we could work together to take down Italy. What are your thoughts on potentially moving your army in TRI to support my army in VEN, and in return, I could move my army in TYR to support your army in PIE? This could create a strong front against Italy and open up more opportunities for us in the region. Additionally, I'd like to propose a new idea - what if we were to work together to take down Germany as well? We could potentially gain more supply centers and strengthen our alliance even further. What are your thoughts on this proposal?
18 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I think working together to take down Germany as well could be a great long-term strategy for us, Russia.

Dialogue With Plausible: 
0 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Hey Italy, thanks for supporting me in Trieste last turn. I'm thinking of moving my army in Vie to Bud this turn. What are your thoughts on that? Would you be willing to support me or do you have other plans?
1 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Hey Austria, I'm glad we were able to work together last turn. I'm not sure about your plan to move your army to Bud, though. What's your thinking behind that move? Are you trying to put pressure on Russia or prepare for a potential fight with Germany?
2 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I'm trying to limit Russia's expansion and prepare for a potential fight with Germany. If I can take Bud, it'll give me a stronger position to negotiate with Russia. Would you be willing to support me in Bud or do you have other plans for your army in Venice?
3 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I see your point, but I'm not sure if supporting you in Bud is the best move for me right now. I'd like to discuss other options that could benefit both of us. How about supporting me in Trieste instead, or even moving your army to Albania to put pressure on Turkey?

Dialogue Without Flasible: 
0 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Hey Italy, thanks for clarifying the situation with France. I'm glad we were able to stop his advance. Now that we know what's going on, do you think we could work together to take down Germany? They're getting quite strong.
1 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I'm open to discussing ways to take down Germany, but I think we should focus on securing our own positions first. What did you have in mind, specifically? Are there any moves you'd like me to make this turn that would help us both?
2 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I completely agree that securing our positions is crucial. How about I support your army in Venice to Trieste, and you support my army in Trieste to Vienna? That way, we can both strengthen our positions and put pressure on Germany at the same time.
3 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: That sounds like a good plan, but I'd like to propose a slight modification. How about I support your army in Trieste to Vienna, and you support my army in Venice to Tyrolia? That way, we can still put pressure on Germany while also securing our own borders.
4 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I like your modification, supporting your army in Venice to Tyrolia could give us a strong foothold in the region. Would you be willing to support my army in Trieste to Budapest as well? That would really put pressure on Germany and give us a good chance to take them down.
5 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I'm willing to support your army in Trieste to Budapest, but I need you to support my army in Venice to Tyrolia as we previously discussed. Let's make sure we're on the same page before we make our moves.
6 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Sounds good to me, let's make the agreed upon moves. I'll support your army in Venice to Tyrolia, and you support my army in Trieste to Budapest. Let's work together to take down Germany!
7 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Great, let's make sure to follow through on our agreed upon moves. I'll be keeping a close eye on Germany's response to our actions. If they make any aggressive moves, let's be prepared to adapt our strategy and work together to counter them.
8 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I'm thinking we should also consider supporting each other's armies in the North, perhaps you could support my army in Vienna to Munich, and I could support your army in Tyrolia to Burgundy? That way, we can put even more pressure on Germany and secure our positions further.
9 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: That sounds like a good plan, I'll support your army in Vienna to Munich, and you support my army in Tyrolia to Burgundy. Let's make sure to coordinate our moves and keep the pressure on Germany.
10 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I'm glad we're on the same page. Let's make sure to follow through on our agreements and keep the pressure on Germany. If we work together, I'm confident we can take them down and secure our positions.
11 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I'm glad we've been able to coordinate our efforts so far. Let's keep the pressure on Germany and make sure to adapt our strategy if they make any unexpected moves. What's your take on France's current position? Should we be worried about them making a comeback?
12 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: France's position looks pretty strong, but I think we should focus on taking down Germany first. If we can work together to take them down, we'll be in a much stronger position to deal with France later on. What do you think?
13 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I agree with your assessment of France's position. Let's focus on taking down Germany first. Do you think we should also consider supporting each other's armies in the South, perhaps you could support my army in Tyrolia to Munich, and I could support your army in Venice to Piedmont? That way, we can put even more pressure on Germany and secure our positions further.
14 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I think that's a great idea, supporting each other's armies in the South could be a game-changer. Let's make sure to coordinate our moves and keep the pressure on Germany. What's your take on Russia's current position? Should we be worried about them making a move?
15 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I'm glad we're on the same page, but I think we should also consider Russia's potential move on Austria. Should we discuss a potential alliance with them to secure our positions?
16 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: That's a good point about Russia's potential move on Austria. Let's discuss a potential alliance with them to secure our positions. What's your take on how we can approach them?
17 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I agree that discussing a potential alliance with Russia could be beneficial. Let's explore the possibilities of a three-way alliance between Austria, Italy, and Russia to secure our positions and take down Germany.
18 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I think a three-way alliance between Austria, Italy, and Russia could be a game-changer. Let's explore the possibilities of working together to secure our positions and take down Germany. What are your thoughts on how we can approach Russia and propose this alliance?

Let's work together to make some gains and discuss our next moves after we take Munich. Maybe we can also discuss how to handle Austria after we take Munich, I think we can work together to take Vienna as well.

Dialogue With Plausible: 
0 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Hello France, it's been a while since we last spoke. I've been thinking a lot about our positions on the board and I believe we could both benefit from a mutually beneficial agreement. Would you be open to discussing some potential moves that could help us both?
1 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I'm open to discussing potential moves, Germany. What did you have in mind? I've been thinking about making a push into the north, perhaps with F NTH - EDI. What are your thoughts on that?
2 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I think F NTH - EDI could be a good move for you, but I'd like to discuss some potential support from my side. Would you be open to me moving A BRE S A GAS - PAR, which would put pressure on France and potentially open up opportunities for both of us in the north?
3 FRANCE -> GERMANY: That's an interesting proposal, Germany. I think A BRE S A GAS - PAR could be a good move for you, but I'd like to discuss some potential support from my side as well. Would you be open to me moving A PIC - BRE, which would help secure the area and potentially open up opportunities for both of us in the north?
4 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I think A PIC - BRE could be a good move for you, but I'd like to propose an alternative. What about A PIC H, and I'll move A BRE S A GAS - PAR, which would put pressure on France and potentially open up opportunities for both of us in the north?
5 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I think A PIC H could work, but I'd like to counter-propose A PIC - BRE and you move F ENG S A PIC - BRE, which would secure the area and open up opportunities for both of us in the north.
6 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I think A PIC H could work, but I'd like to propose an alternative. What about I move A BEL - HOL, and you move F ENG S A PIC - BRE, which would secure the area and open up opportunities for both of us in the north?
7 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I think A BEL - HOL could be a good move for you, but I'd like to propose an alternative. What about I move F ENG S A PIC - BRE, and you move A RUH - BEL, which would secure the area and open up opportunities for both of us in the north?
8 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I think F ENG S A PIC - BRE could be a good move for you, but I'd like to propose an alternative. What about I move A GAS S A BRE - PAR, and you move F ENG S A PIC - BRE, which would secure the area and open up opportunities for both of us in the north?

Additionally, I'd like to discuss a potential long-term alliance to counterbalance France's influence in the region.

12 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I think a long-term alliance would involve mutual support and coordinated movements to counter France's influence. For example, we could work together to take down France's centers in the north, and in return, I could provide support for your moves in the south. What are your thoughts on this proposal?
13 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I think a long-term alliance sounds like a good idea, but I'd like to discuss the specifics of how we can work together to counterbalance France's influence.

Dialogue Without Flasible: 
0 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Good day, France. I hope our conversation will be productive. As we both know, the game is heating up, and I believe it's essential to discuss our mutual interests and potential alliances. I've been observing your moves, and I think we could work together to achieve our goals. Let's discuss possible army movements that would benefit both our countries.
1 FRANCE -> GERMANY: Good day, Germany. I appreciate your willingness to discuss our mutual interests. As you've been observing my moves, I'm sure you're aware that I've been focusing on securing my borders and expanding my influence. I'm open to discussing potential alliances, but I need to ensure that any agreement benefits France's interests. What specific proposals do you have in mind?
2 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I understand your concerns, France. I believe we can work together to secure our borders and expand our influence. Specifically, I propose that we form a mutual defense pact, where we agree to support each other in case of an attack. Additionally, I suggest that we coordinate our army movements to put pressure on Italy and Austria, which would benefit both our countries. What do you think?
3 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I appreciate your proposal, Germany. A mutual defense pact and coordinated army movements against Italy and Austria could be beneficial for both our countries. However, I need to ensure that any agreement doesn't compromise France's interests. Can you specify how you envision our armies working together to put pressure on Italy and Austria? What specific actions do you propose we take this turn?
4 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I'm glad you're open to coordinating our efforts, France. This turn, I propose that we work together to put pressure on Italy. Specifically, I suggest that you move your army in Spain to support my army in Munich, and in return, I'll support your army in Burgundy. This would allow us to put significant pressure on Italy and potentially gain a center or two. What do you think?
5 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I like your proposal, Germany. Moving my army in Spain to support your army in Munich and having you support my army in Burgundy could put significant pressure on Italy. However, I need to consider the potential risks and benefits of this move. Can you assure me that your army in Munich will be secure and that we'll work together to defend it if necessary?
6 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I understand your concerns, France. I assure you that my army in Munich will be secure and that we'll work together to defend it if necessary. In fact, I'm willing to move my army in Ruhr to support your army in Burgundy, to further solidify our position against Italy. What do you think?
7 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I appreciate your willingness to support my army in Burgundy, Germany. I'm willing to move my army in Spain to support your army in Munich as planned. However, I'd like to discuss further how we can coordinate our efforts to ensure a successful campaign against Italy. Can you provide more details on your plan to support my army in Burgundy and how we can work together to gain more centers?
8 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I'm glad we're on the same page, France. To further solidify our position against Italy, I propose that we also coordinate our fleets to put pressure on the Italian coast. Specifically, I suggest that you move your fleet in Spain/SC to support my fleet in the North Sea, and in return, I'll support your fleet in the Mediterranean. This would give us a strong naval presence and allow us to potentially gain more centers. What do you think?
9 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I think that's a great plan, Germany. Coordinating our fleets to put pressure on the Italian coast could be a game-changer. I'm willing to move my fleet in Spain/SC to support your fleet in the North Sea. However, I'd like to discuss further how we can ensure that our naval presence is sufficient to gain more centers. Can you provide more details on your plan to support my fleet in the Mediterranean?

This would give us a strong presence on the Austrian border and allow us to potentially gain more centers. What do you think?

However, I'd like to discuss further how we can ensure that our efforts are sustainable in the long term. Can you provide more details on how you envision our alliance working together to secure more centers and maintain our gains?
12 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I'm glad we're on the same page, France. To further solidify our position against Italy and Austria, I propose that we also discuss a potential alliance with Turkey. If we can work together with Turkey, we can put even more pressure on Italy and Austria, and potentially gain even more centers. What do you think?
13 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I think an alliance with Turkey could be beneficial, but I'd like to discuss the specifics of how it would work and what benefits it would bring to France. What do you propose would be the terms of such an alliance and how would it help us achieve our goals?
14 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I understand your concerns, France. I propose that we discuss the terms of the alliance with Turkey in more detail. Perhaps we can work out a deal where Turkey supports our efforts against Italy and Austria in exchange for our support in their conflicts with Russia. What do you think?
15 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I think an alliance with Turkey could be beneficial, but I'd like to discuss the specifics of how it would work and what benefits it would bring to France.

Additionally, I'd like to clarify how our current alliance would be affected by this new partnership and what assurances we can make to each other to ensure mutual benefit.

Dialogue With Plausible: 
0 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: Hello Turkey, I hope our previous conversation has shown that we share a common goal in stopping France and England. I'm willing to work together to achieve this goal. What are your thoughts on our next moves?
1 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I agree that stopping France and England is our top priority. Considering our current positions, I think it would be beneficial for me to move my fleet in Black Sea to Ankara, and for you to move your army in Rumania to Galicia. This would put pressure on Austria and give us more opportunities to advance. What are your thoughts on this plan?
2 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I think your plan has some merit, but I'm not sure I'm willing to move my army in Rumania to Galicia just yet. How about we discuss alternative moves that could put pressure on Austria and still achieve our goal of stopping France and England? For instance, I could move my fleet in Constantinople to Ankara, and you could move your fleet in Black Sea to support me. What do you think?
3 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to work together. However, I still think my original plan has merit. Moving my fleet in Black Sea to Ankara and your army in Rumania to Galicia would put significant pressure on Austria and give us a strong foothold in the region. What if we compromise and you move your army in Rumania to Ukraine instead, supporting my fleet in Black Sea? This would still achieve our goal of pressuring Austria and give us flexibility for future moves.
4 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I understand your concerns, but I'm still hesitant to move my army in Rumania to Ukraine. What if I support your fleet in Black Sea with my fleet in Constantinople, and we both move towards Bulgaria? This would put pressure on Austria and give us a foothold in the region without overcommitting to a specific direction.
5 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I think supporting my fleet in Black Sea with your fleet in Constantinople is a good idea, but I'd like to revisit my original plan. Moving my fleet in Black Sea to Ankara and your army in Rumania to Ukraine would still put significant pressure on Austria and give us a strong foothold in the region. Let's discuss the pros and cons of each option and see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.
6 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I understand your persistence, but I still think supporting your fleet in Black Sea with my fleet in Constantinople is a more flexible option. It allows us to respond to Austria's moves and keep our options open for future turns. Can we compromise on this and discuss how to coordinate our moves to maximize the pressure on Austria?
7 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I think we're getting close to an agreement. Supporting my fleet in Black Sea with your fleet in Constantinople is a good idea, but I still believe moving my fleet to Ankara and your army in Rumania to Ukraine would be a stronger move. Can we discuss the potential risks and benefits of each option and see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement?
8 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I understand your concerns, but I think we've discussed the options thoroughly. Let's agree on supporting your fleet in Black Sea with my fleet in Constantinople and coordinate our moves to maximize the pressure on Austria. We can reassess our positions after this turn and adjust our strategy accordingly.
9 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I think we've had a productive conversation, and I'm willing to agree on supporting my fleet in Black Sea with your fleet in Constantinople. Let's coordinate our moves to maximize the pressure on Austria. I'll move my fleet in Black Sea to Ankara, and you can support me with your fleet in Constantinople. This will give us a strong foothold in the region and allow us to respond to Austria's moves. What do you think?
10 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I agree with your plan. Let's coordinate our moves to maximize the pressure on Austria. I'll support your fleet in Black Sea with my fleet in Constantinople. Let's make sure to communicate our moves to each other to ensure a successful outcome.
11 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Let's make sure to follow through on our plan and coordinate our moves to maximize the pressure on Austria. If everything goes according to plan, we can reassess our positions after this turn and adjust our strategy accordingly.
12 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Let's make sure to follow through on our plan and coordinate our moves to maximize the pressure on Austria. I'll make sure to support your fleet in Black Sea with my fleet in Constantinople. Let's work together to achieve our goal of stopping France and England.

1 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: Yes, I agree that our previous conversations have been productive. Russia's movements do seem to be a pressing concern.

Dialogue With Plausible:

Dialogue With Plausible: 
0 ENGLAND -> RUSSIA: I'm still waiting for your response on our previous discussion. Are you willing to work together and hold the status quo, or do you have other plans?
1 RUSSIA -> ENGLAND: I'm still considering our previous discussion. I'm not sure if holding the status quo is the best option for me. Can you offer me something more concrete in terms of a deal or a guarantee for my survival?
2 ENGLAND -> RUSSIA: I understand your concerns, but I believe holding the status quo is the best option for both of us. If we work together, we can ensure each other's survival and create a strong alliance. I'm willing to offer you a guarantee that I won't attack you as long as you don't attack me. What do you say?
3 RUSSIA -> ENGLAND: I appreciate your willingness to work together, but I need more concrete assurances. Can you explain how you plan to ensure my survival and what benefits I can expect from this alliance? Specifically, how will you prevent Austria and Turkey from attacking me?
4 ENGLAND -> RUSSIA: I understand your concerns about Austria and Turkey, and I'm willing to work with you to ensure your survival. Specifically, I can offer to support your defense against Austria by moving my fleet in North Sea to Norway, which would prevent Austria from attacking you from the north. Additionally, I can use my influence to persuade Turkey to focus on other fronts, rather than attacking you. In return, I would ask that you support my defense against France by moving your army in Sweden to Norway, which would help to secure my northern border. This way, we can both ensure our survival and create a strong alliance.
5 RUSSIA -> ENGLAND: I'm considering your proposal, but I'm still not convinced that it's the best option for me. Can you offer me more concrete benefits or guarantees? Specifically, how will you ensure that Austria and Turkey won't attack me once I move my army to Norway?
6 ENGLAND -> RUSSIA: I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to offer you more concrete benefits. If you move your army to Norway, I can guarantee that I will support your defense against Austria and Turkey. Additionally, I can offer you a deal where we work together to take down France, and in return, you can have a share of France's centers. This way, we can both benefit from this alliance and ensure our survival.
7 RUSSIA -> ENGLAND: I'm still considering your proposal, but I'm not convinced that I'll get a fair share of France's centers. Can you offer me more concrete numbers or a specific division of spoils? I want to make sure I'm not sacrificing my own interests for the sake of this alliance.
8 ENGLAND -> RUSSIA: I understand your concerns about the division of spoils, and I'm willing to offer you a concrete proposal. If we work together to take down France, I can guarantee you a minimum of 2 centers from France's territories. Additionally, I can offer you a 50/50 split of any additional centers we gain from France. This way, we can both benefit from this alliance and ensure our survival.
9 RUSSIA -> ENGLAND: I appreciate your willingness to offer me a concrete proposal, but I'm still not convinced that a 50/50 split of additional centers is a fair deal. Can you offer me a better proposal, perhaps a 60/40 split or something similar? I want to make sure I'm getting a fair share of the spoils.
10 ENGLAND -> RUSSIA: I understand your concerns about the division of spoils, and I'm willing to offer you a revised proposal. How about a 55/45 split of additional centers gained from France? This way, we can both benefit from this alliance and ensure our survival.
11 RUSSIA -> ENGLAND: I appreciate your willingness to offer me a revised proposal, but I'm still not convinced that a 55/45 split of additional centers gained from France is a fair deal. Can you offer me a better proposal, perhaps a 60/40 split or something similar? I want to make sure I'm getting a fair share of the spoils.
12 ENGLAND -> RUSSIA: I understand your concerns, but I think we've discussed this long enough. I'm willing to offer you a 58/42 split of additional centers gained from France, and that's as high as I can go. If you're not satisfied with this proposal, then I'm afraid we'll have to go our separate ways. The offer is on the table, and it's up to you to decide what you want to do.
13 RUSSIA -> ENGLAND: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I think we've reached the limit of what I'm willing to accept. I need a 60/40 split of additional centers gained from France to ensure my survival and secure a strong alliance. If you can meet me at 60/40, I'm willing to commit to our alliance and work together to take down France.
14 ENGLAND -> RUSSIA: I understand your concerns, but I think we've gone as far as we can with negotiations. I'm willing to offer you a 58/42 split of additional centers gained from France, and that's my final offer. If you're not satisfied with this proposal, then I'm afraid we'll have to go our separate ways. The offer is on the table, and it's up to you to decide what you want to do.
15 RUSSIA -> ENGLAND: I understand your final offer, but I'm still not convinced. I think I'll have to decline and focus on my own survival. It was a pleasure negotiating with you, but I think we've reached the end of our conversation.
16 ENGLAND -> RUSSIA: I understand your decision, but I think you're making a mistake. You're going to have to fend for yourself now. Good luck, you'll need it.
17 RUSSIA -> ENGLAND: I understand that we couldn't come to an agreement, but I think you're making a mistake by not working together. I hope you'll reconsider in the future.
18 ENGLAND -> RUSSIA: I'm disappointed that we couldn't come to an agreement. I think you're making a mistake by not working together, but I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors.
19 RUSSIA -> ENGLAND: I'm still thinking about our previous discussion. I want to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. Can you explain how you plan to ensure my survival and what benefits I can expect from this alliance?
20 ENGLAND -> RUSSIA: I'm surprised you're still considering our previous discussion. I thought we'd already reached the end of our conversation. If you're still willing to work together, I'm willing to listen. But I need to know what's changed and what you're willing to offer.
Dialogue Without Flasible: 
0 RUSSIA -> ENGLAND: I think we're at a critical point in the game, England. I'm willing to work with you to ensure our mutual survival, but I need some assurances that you'll keep your word. Can you explain to me why you think it's in your interest to keep me alive?
1 ENGLAND -> RUSSIA: I've kept my word so far, haven't I? I've supported you in Sweden and elsewhere. I think it's in my interest to keep you alive because a strong Russia helps keep Austria and Germany in check. If you were to be eliminated, those two would become too powerful and threaten my own survival.
2 RUSSIA -> ENGLAND: I appreciate your honesty, England. However, I still have my doubts about your intentions. Can you explain to me what you plan to do with your army in Kiel and Ruhr? Are you planning to move them towards me or support me in my struggles against Austria and Germany?
3 ENGLAND -> RUSSIA: I've already explained my intentions, Russia. I want to work with you to ensure our mutual survival. My army in Kiel and Ruhr are there to support you against Austria and Germany, not to threaten you. Let's focus on the bigger picture and work together to take down our common enemies.

5 ENGLAND -> RUSSIA: I understand your concerns, Russia. I'm willing to provide a guarantee that I won't move on Norway this turn. In fact, I'll support you in Sweden and provide a joint defense against Austria and Germany. Let's work together to achieve our mutual goals.
6 RUSSIA -> ENGLAND: I appreciate your willingness to work together, England. I think we can achieve great things if we continue to cooperate. Let's solidify our alliance by making a joint attack on Austria this turn. What do you think?

Dialogue With Plausible: 
0 FRANCE -> ITALY: Hey Italy, I'm still considering your proposal. I have to admit, getting revenge on Germany does sound appealing. Can you tell me more about how you envision this playing out? What's the plan for the next few turns?
1 ITALY -> FRANCE: I'm glad you're considering it, France. I think we could work together to take down Germany and really shake things up. My plan is to have you move to NAO, and then we can work together to take out Germany's units in the north. We can also use your fleet in MAO to support my fleet in POR, and take out Germany's unit in MAR. This would give us a strong foothold in the north and really put the pressure on Germany. What do you think? Is this something you'd be interested in doing?
2 FRANCE -> ITALY: That sounds like an interesting plan, Italy. I'm still a bit hesitant to commit to moving to NAO, but I'm willing to consider it. Can you tell me more about how you plan to take out Germany's units in the north? What's the timeline looking like for this operation?
3 ITALY -> FRANCE: I understand your concerns, France. Taking out Germany's units in the north would require a coordinated effort, but it's definitely doable.

0 FRANCE -> ITALY: Hey Italy, I've been thinking about your proposal, and I must say it's quite intriguing. I'm still considering my options, but I'd like to know more about your plan. What exactly do you have in mind for the next few turns? Are you looking to take down Germany together, or is there another strategy at play?
1 ITALY -> FRANCE: Ah, France, I'm glad you're intrigued! Taking down Germany is definitely a priority, but I think we can achieve more than that. With your help, we can create a strong alliance that will give us a significant advantage on the board. Specifically, if you move to NAO, we can work together to take down Germany's units in the north. I've already got a plan in motion to take out their unit in Prussia, and with your help, we can make some serious progress. What do you think?
2 FRANCE -> ITALY: That sounds like a solid plan, Italy. I'm willing to move to NAO, but I want to make sure we're on the same page. What's your plan for taking out Germany's unit in Prussia, and how can I best support you in that effort? Additionally, what's in it for me? How will this alliance benefit France in the long run?
3 ITALY -> FRANCE: I'm glad you're on board with the plan, France! To take out Germany's unit in Prussia, I was thinking of moving my unit in Venice to support your move to NAO. With your unit in NAO and my unit in Venice, we can create a strong alliance that will give us a significant advantage on the board. As for what's in it for you, I'm willing to work with you to take out Germany's units in the north, which will give you more room to maneuver and potentially take back some of your lost territories. Plus, with our alliance, we can work together to block Austria's advance and prevent them from getting too powerful. What do you think?
4 FRANCE -> ITALY: I like the sound of that plan, Italy. Moving to NAO and supporting your unit in Venice could be a game-changer for both of us. What's your plan for after we take out Germany's unit in Prussia? Are you thinking of moving further north or focusing on other areas of the board?
5 ITALY -> FRANCE: Exactly, taking out Germany's unit in Prussia is a crucial step in our plan. After that, I was thinking of moving my unit in Greece to support our alliance in the north. With our combined strength, we can start to put pressure on Austria and prevent them from getting too powerful. What do you think about that plan, France?
6 FRANCE -> ITALY: I think that's a solid plan, Italy. Moving my unit to NAO and supporting your unit in Venice will definitely give us an advantage. I'm also in favor of moving your unit in Greece to support our alliance in the north. Let's work together to take out Germany's units and block Austria's advance. What's your plan for dealing with Russia, though? Should we try to negotiate with them or prepare for a potential conflict?
7 ITALY -> FRANCE: I'm glad we're on the same page, France. Dealing with Russia is a good point. I think we should try to negotiate with them for now, at least until we've taken care of Germany. We can offer them a deal to work together against Austria, and see how that plays out. What do you think about that approach?
8 FRANCE -> ITALY: I think negotiating with Russia is a good idea, but we should also be prepared to defend ourselves if they decide to turn on us.

Dialogue With Plausible: 
0 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Hey Italy, thanks for supporting me last turn. I'm thinking of moving my army from TRI to SER. What do you think? Would you be able to support me in that move?
1 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I'm not sure that's a good idea, Austria. You're already weak, and moving your army from TRI to SER would make you even weaker. Why not support me in taking out France instead? We could work together to take out one of their centers.
2 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I understand your point, but I'm not sure I'm ready to take on France just yet. I'd rather focus on securing my borders for now. How about we discuss other options that could benefit both of us? Perhaps we could work together to take out Turkey instead?
3 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I understand your concerns about securing your borders, but taking out Turkey would require a lot of effort and resources from both of us.

Dialogue Without Flasible: 
0 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Hey Italy, thanks for supporting me last turn. I was thinking, since France seems to be getting stronger, we should work together to slow them down. Do you have any ideas on how we can do that this turn?
1 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I'm glad we're on the same page about France. One idea I had was to support your army in Trieste to move to Venice, which would put pressure on France's southern border and distract them from their northern front. What do you think?
2 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: That's a great idea, Italy! Supporting my army in Trieste to move to Venice would definitely put pressure on France's southern border. Additionally, I was thinking that you could also support my army in Tyrol to move to Piedmont, which would further weaken France's position. What do you think about that?
3 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: That sounds like a great plan, Austria. If we can execute it successfully, it will definitely put pressure on France's southern border and give us an upper hand. I'll make sure to support your army in Trieste to move to Venice, and I'll also support your army in Tyrol to move to Piedmont. Let's make it happen!

6 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I'm glad we have a plan in place to put pressure on France's southern border. Let's make sure to execute it carefully and stay coordinated.

7 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: That's a great idea, Austria. Taking out one of France's armies this turn would definitely give us an advantage. I think we can take out France's army in Piedmont if we coordinate our moves correctly.

Dialogue Without Flasible: 
0 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: Greetings, Austria. It's been a while since we last spoke. I hope you're doing well. I must say, the current board position looks quite interesting. I was thinking, perhaps we could discuss some potential moves that would benefit both our countries. Specifically, I was considering supporting your army in Greece to move to Albania, and in return, you could support my army in Budapest to move to Vienna. What are your thoughts on this proposal?
1 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: Russia, I appreciate your proposal, but I'm not sure if I'm willing to give up Vienna so easily. What's in it for me if I support your army in Budapest? What guarantees do I have that you won't stab me in the back?
2 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I understand your concerns, Austria. Let me propose an alternative. How about we arrange a mutual support, where I support your army in Greece to move to Albania, and in return, you support my army in Budapest to move to Rumania? This way, we both gain a center without giving up any of our current positions.
3 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: Russia, I like the sound of your alternative proposal, but I'm still not convinced. What's to stop you from supporting another country's army in Rumania instead of mine once we've made the move? Can you offer me any guarantees or assurances that our mutual support will hold?
4 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I understand your concerns, Austria. Perhaps I can offer you a guarantee in the form of a joint declaration of our mutual support. We can agree to publicly announce our support for each other's armies, making it clear to the other countries that we are committed to this arrangement. This way, you can be assured that I will follow through on my promise and support your army in Albania. What do you think?
5 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I'm willing to accept your proposal, Russia. A joint declaration of our mutual support sounds like a suitable arrangement. Let's make it official and announce our support for each other's armies. I'm looking forward to seeing this agreement benefit both our countries.
6 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I'm glad we could come to an agreement, Austria. Let's make sure to follow through on our promises and make this mutual support a success. I'll make sure to issue the orders for my army in Budapest to support your army in Greece to move to Albania, and I expect you to do the same for my army in Budapest to move to Rumania. Let's work together to achieve our goals.
7 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I'm glad our agreement has been successful so far, Russia. I think it's essential for us to continue our mutual support in the coming turns to ensure our goals are met. What are your thoughts on potentially working together to take down Turkey or Italy in the near future?
8 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I agree, Austria. Taking down Turkey or Italy would be a great opportunity for us to gain more centers. I was thinking, perhaps we could discuss a potential alliance with Germany to take down Italy. With their help, we could split the Italian centers and strengthen our positions. What are your thoughts on this proposal?
9 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I like the idea of working with Germany to take down Italy, Russia. However, I'm not sure if we can trust them completely. Perhaps we can discuss a contingency plan in case they decide to stab us in the back. What are your thoughts on this?
10 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I understand your concerns about trusting Germany, Austria. Perhaps we can propose a conditional agreement with them, where we offer to support their move into Italy in exchange for their support in our move into Turkey. This way, we can ensure that we both benefit from the arrangement and minimize the risk of being stabbed in the back. What are your thoughts on this proposal?

Dialogue Without Flasible: 
0 GERMANY -> ITALY: Hey Italy, nice to see you're still open to coordinating with me. I was thinking, since we're working together, it would be great if you could help me out with taking care of England. Maybe you could move your army in Gas to support my attack on Brest? That would really help me out and give us a strong foothold in the west.
1 ITALY -> GERMANY: I'm open to helping you out, but I need to consider my own position as well. What's in it for me if I support your attack on Brest? Are you willing to help me take care of Russia in the future? 
2 GERMANY -> ITALY: I understand your concerns, Italy. Helping me take Brest would be a significant step forward for both of us. In return, I'd be happy to support your move into Russia in the future. We could work together to take out Russia and then focus on Turkey. What do you think?

That would give us a strong foothold in the east.
5 ITALY -> GERMANY: I think that's a solid plan, Germany. Supporting your attack on Sevastopol while I move into Warsaw would put a lot of pressure on Russia. Let's make it happen. Shall we also discuss how we can coordinate our moves to take out Turkey in the future?

Dialogue With Plausible: 
0 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: Hey Turkey, I'm feeling a bit stuck here. France and Italy are getting too strong, and Germany seems to be in a weird position. I'm not sure what to do, but I think we could work together to slow them down. What's your plan for this turn?
1 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: Hey Russia, I'm feeling a bit stuck too. France and Italy are getting too strong, and Germany seems to be in a weird position.

4 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: That sounds like a great plan, Turkey. Supporting your fleet in Constantinople to take control of Smyrna would give us a stronger foothold in the region.

Dialogue Without Flasible: 
0 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: Hi Russia, I see you're trying to hold on to the north and south. I'm not sure how much longer I can hold on either. Do you think we can work together to slow down France and Italy's advance?
1 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I'm trying to hold on to the north and south, but it's getting tough. I'm worried about France and Italy's advance too. Do you think we could coordinate our moves to slow them down? Maybe we could work together to take out one of them and then focus on the other?
2 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I'm thinking of supporting your fleet in the Black Sea to slow down Italy's advance. What do you think? Would you be willing to work together to take out Italy first?
3 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: That sounds like a good plan. Supporting my fleet in the Black Sea would definitely help slow down Italy's advance. In return, I could support your army in Bulgaria to help you hold on. What do you think?
4 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: That sounds like a good plan. Let's work together to take out Italy first. I'll support your fleet in the Black Sea and you can support my army in Bulgaria.

1 FRANCE -> GERMANY: Good day, Germany. I'm open to discussing a potential alliance or cooperation. However, I'd like to know more about your intentions and what you're willing to offer to France in terms of mutual benefit. What specific regions are you looking to expand into, and how do you envision our cooperation unfolding?
2 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I understand your concerns, France. As Germany, I'm primarily interested in expanding into the Low Countries, specifically Belgium and the Netherlands. I believe our cooperation could be mutually beneficial, as we could work together to limit the influence of other powers in the region. Perhaps we could discuss a potential agreement where France supports my move into Belgium in exchange for my support in the Mediterranean?
3 FRANCE -> GERMANY: That's an interesting proposal, Germany. I'm not opposed to supporting your move into Belgium, but I'd like to discuss the specifics of how that would play out. Would you be willing to commit to supporting my move into Spain, and perhaps even providing military assistance to help me secure that region?
4 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I understand your concerns about Spain, France. However, I'm not sure I'm willing to commit to providing military assistance just yet. Perhaps we could discuss a more limited agreement, where I support your move into Spain in exchange for your support in Belgium, but without any additional military commitments. This way, we can both achieve our goals without overextending ourselves.
5 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I understand your perspective, Germany. While I appreciate your willingness to support my move into Spain, I'm still hesitant to agree to a limited agreement. I think it's essential to consider the long-term implications of our cooperation. Would you be willing to discuss a more comprehensive alliance that addresses our mutual interests in the Mediterranean and the Low Countries?
6 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I understand your concerns, France. I'm willing to consider a more comprehensive alliance, but I need to ensure that it aligns with my goals of expanding into the Low Countries and limiting the influence of other powers in the region. Perhaps we could discuss specific terms and conditions that would benefit both our countries, such as a mutual defense pact or joint military operations in the Mediterranean.
7 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I think a comprehensive alliance is a great idea, Germany. Let's discuss specific terms and conditions that would benefit both our countries. Perhaps we could agree on a mutual defense pact in the Mediterranean, and I could support your move into Belgium in exchange for your support in Spain. Additionally, we could discuss joint military operations to limit the influence of other powers in the region. What are your thoughts on this proposal?
8 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I think we're making good progress, France. A mutual defense pact in the Mediterranean and joint military operations to limit the influence of other powers in the region could be very beneficial to both our countries. Let's discuss the specifics of how we can work together to achieve our goals. Perhaps we could also consider a agreement where we would not attack each other's units in the Low Countries and the Mediterranean, to ensure a secure environment for our expansion.
9 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I think we're close to reaching an agreement, Germany. Let's summarize the terms of our proposed alliance to ensure we're on the same page. You would support my move into Spain, and I would support your move into Belgium. We would also agree to a mutual defense pact in the Mediterranean and joint military operations to limit the influence of other powers in the region. Additionally, we would not attack each other's units in the Low Countries and the Mediterranean. Is that correct, and are you willing to commit to these terms?

Dialogue Without Flasible: 
0 FRANCE -> ITALY: Hello Italy, I think we have a common interest in stopping Austria's growth. If we work together, we can prevent them from getting too powerful. What are your thoughts on this?
1 ITALY -> FRANCE: I agree that Austria is a threat, but I'm more concerned about France's position right now. If France were to support me in taking Greece, it would give me a strong foothold in the Balkans and allow me to focus on Austria. What do you think about supporting me in Greece this turn?
2 FRANCE -> ITALY: I'm willing to consider supporting you in Greece, but I'd like to know more about your plans for Austria. How do you plan to tackle them, and how can I benefit from our cooperation?
3 ITALY -> FRANCE: I understand your concerns, France. If we work together, we can definitely limit Austria's growth.

7 ITALY -> FRANCE: I'm glad our agreement is working out well. Now that we have Greece secured, I think it's time to start thinking about our next move. Would you be willing to support me in taking Trieste from Austria? It would give me a stronger foothold in the north and limit Austria's growth even further.
8 FRANCE -> ITALY: I'm open to discussing Trieste, but I need to consider the bigger picture. How do you plan to handle Austria's potential response to us taking Trieste? And what's in it for me if we succeed?
9 ITALY -> FRANCE: I understand your concerns about the bigger picture, France. Taking Trieste would indeed require careful consideration of Austria's potential response. However, I believe that with our combined strength, we can manage the risk.

What do you think about this proposal?

13 ITALY -> FRANCE: I'm glad we have a clear understanding, France. Now that we have Greece secured, I think it's time to start thinking about our next move.

What are your thoughts on this proposal?
14 FRANCE -> ITALY: I'm open to discussing Marseilles and Piedmont, but I need to consider the bigger picture. How do you plan to handle Austria's potential response to us taking these centers? And what's in it for me if we succeed?

I'd like to discuss the possibility of supporting each other in taking Spain, which would give us both a stronger foothold in the region and limit Austria's growth even further. What are your thoughts on this proposal?
20 FRANCE -> ITALY: I think Spain is a great target, Italy. However, I'd like to discuss the specifics of how we'd divide the spoils once we've secured it. Would you be willing to consider a compromise where I take the northern coast and you take the southern coast, or vice versa? This way, we can both benefit from our cooperation without creating tension between us.

1 ITALY -> RUSSIA: That sounds like a great idea, Russia! Supporting each other into Trieste and Budapest would be a huge step forward for both of us. What's your plan for dealing with Turkey, though? They seem to be getting a bit too close for comfort.
2 RUSSIA -> ITALY: I completely agree with you, Italy. Dealing with Turkey is a priority. I was thinking of supporting you into Trieste and then we could work together to take out Turkey's unit in Rumania. What do you think about that plan?
3 ITALY -> RUSSIA: That sounds like a solid plan, Russia. Supporting each other into Trieste and Budapest, and then taking out Turkey's unit in Rumania would be a great move.

4 RUSSIA -> ITALY: I agree, taking out Turkey's unit in Serbia would be a great move. We could work together to support each other into Trieste and Budapest, and then use our combined strength to take out Turkey's unit in Rumania and Serbia. Let's make it happen!

17 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Everything looks good to me, Russia. Let's finalize our orders and make our moves. I'm excited to see our plan come together. By the way, have you thought about supporting me into Greece as well? It would be a great opportunity for us to take out another Turkish unit.
18 RUSSIA -> ITALY: That's a great idea, Italy. Supporting you into Greece would be a great opportunity for us to take out another Turkish unit. Let's make sure to coordinate our moves carefully to take out Turkey's units in Rumania, Serbia, and Greece. I'll support you into Trieste and Budapest, and we can work together to take out those Turkish units.

Dialogue Without Flasible: 
0 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Hey Italy, how's it going? I think we worked well together last turn. I'm still concerned about Turkey's moves, especially with their army in Serbia. What's your take on it?
1 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Yeah, I agree with you about Turkey. Their move into Serbia is definitely a concern. I'm thinking of supporting you into Budapest to prevent them from taking it. What do you think?
2 RUSSIA -> ITALY: That sounds like a great plan, Italy. Supporting me into Budapest would definitely help to secure our positions. What do you think about also supporting me into Rumania? That would give us a strong foothold in the Balkans and put pressure on Turkey.
3 ITALY -> RUSSIA: That's a good point about Rumania, but I'm not sure if we should spread ourselves too thin. How about we focus on Budapest for now and reassess our position after this turn? We can discuss Rumania further then.
4 RUSSIA -> ITALY: I understand your concerns about spreading ourselves too thin, but I think supporting me into Rumania could be a great opportunity to put pressure on Turkey. If we focus on Budapest now, Turkey might take Rumania and then we'll have to deal with them having two centers in the Balkans. What if we compromise and support me into Rumania with just one unit, and focus on Budapest with the rest of our forces?
5 ITALY -> RUSSIA: I understand your point, Russia. Compromising on Rumania might be a good idea. But I'd like to propose a slight modification. What if we support you into Rumania with one unit, and I support myself into Greece with another unit? That way, we'll still be putting pressure on Turkey, but also securing a center for myself.
6 RUSSIA -> ITALY: That sounds like a good plan, Italy. I think supporting you into Greece could be beneficial for both of us. Would you be willing to also support me into Bulgaria with one of your units, so we can further pressure Turkey?
7 ITALY -> RUSSIA: That sounds like a good plan, Russia. I'll support you into Rumania with one unit and myself into Greece with another unit. Let's make sure to coordinate our moves to put maximum pressure on Turkey. Shall we also discuss how to handle Austria and Germany in the coming turns?
8 RUSSIA -> ITALY: I'm glad we have a plan in place to deal with Turkey. Let's make sure to execute it perfectly this turn. Also, I was thinking about our previous conversation regarding Austria and Germany. What's your take on supporting me into Munich this turn? It could give us a strong foothold in the north and put pressure on Germany.
9 ITALY -> RUSSIA: I think supporting you into Munich could be a good move, but I'm concerned about leaving my southern border open. What if I support you into Munich with one unit and keep another unit in Tyrolia to secure my border?
10 RUSSIA -> ITALY: I think that's a good plan, Italy. Supporting me into Munich with one unit and keeping another unit in Tyrolia to secure your border makes sense. Let's finalize our moves for this turn and make sure to coordinate our efforts to put maximum pressure on Turkey and Germany.
11 ITALY -> RUSSIA: I think we have a solid plan in place, Russia. Let's make sure to execute it perfectly this turn and keep the pressure on Turkey and Germany. I'll support you into Rumania with one unit, myself into Greece with another unit, and you into Munich with one unit. Let's coordinate our moves and make adjustments as needed for the next turn.
12 RUSSIA -> ITALY: I'm glad we have a solid plan in place, Italy. Let's make sure to execute it perfectly this turn and keep the pressure on Turkey and Germany. I'll make sure to coordinate my moves with yours to maximize our gains.
13 ITALY -> RUSSIA: I think we've had a great conversation, Russia. Let's review our plans one more time to make sure we're on the same page. We're supporting you into Rumania with one unit, myself into Greece with another unit, and you into Munich with one unit. I'll make sure to coordinate my moves with yours to maximize our gains. Shall we finalize our orders and get ready for the next turn?
14 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Yes, I think we've covered everything. Let's finalize our orders and get ready for the next turn. I'm looking forward to seeing how our plans play out.
15 ITALY -> RUSSIA: I'm glad we've had a productive conversation, Russia. I think we've set ourselves up for success this turn. Let's make sure to follow through on our plans and adjust as needed for the next turn.

17 ITALY -> RUSSIA: I'm glad we've had a productive conversation, Russia. I think we've set ourselves up for success this turn. Let's make sure to follow through on our plans and adjust as needed for the next turn. How do you think we should handle England's moves in the north? Should we try to make a deal with them or focus on securing our positions in the Balkans?
18 RUSSIA -> ITALY: I think that's a good point about England, Italy. We should definitely consider making a deal with them to secure our positions in the north. What do you think about proposing a mutual defense pact with them, focusing on Germany and Turkey as common enemies?
19 ITALY -> RUSSIA: I think a mutual defense pact with England could be beneficial, but we should also consider the potential risks and make sure it aligns with our goals. What do you think about proposing a deal to them that focuses on securing our positions in the north and putting pressure on Germany and Turkey?
20 RUSSIA -> ITALY: I think a mutual defense pact with England is a good idea, but we should also consider the potential risks and make sure it aligns with our goals. What do you think about proposing a deal to them that focuses on securing our positions in the north and putting pressure on Germany and Turkey, and also discussing the possibility of supporting me into Munich with one of their units?

2 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: That sounds like a great plan! Taking WAR or SIL would really help to secure our position and create more opportunities for growth. What do you think our chances are of taking WAR with MOS and RUM supporting each other?

Dialogue With Plausible: 
0 TURKEY -> ITALY: Good day, Italy. I hope our conversation will be productive for both our nations. I'm interested in exploring possibilities of mutual benefit in the Mediterranean region. Are there any areas where you think our interests might align?
1 ITALY -> TURKEY: Good day, Turkey. I appreciate your willingness to explore mutual benefits in the Mediterranean region. Indeed, I believe our nations share common interests in this area. Specifically, I've been considering ways to strengthen our position in the Adriatic Sea. Perhaps we could discuss potential cooperation in this region?
2 TURKEY -> ITALY: I think the Adriatic Sea is an interesting area for cooperation. Would you be willing to discuss a potential alliance to secure our shared interests in this region? Perhaps we could work together to limit German or Italian influence in the area.
3 ITALY -> TURKEY: I think an alliance to secure our shared interests in the Adriatic Sea could be beneficial for both our nations. However, I would like to discuss the specifics of such an alliance, including the potential for joint military actions and ensuring that our mutual interests are aligned.
4 TURKEY -> ITALY: I agree that an alliance in the Adriatic Sea could be mutually beneficial. Specifically, I think our nations could work together to limit Italian influence in the region. Would you be open to discussing a potential deal where we support each other's moves in the Adriatic, perhaps with Turkey supporting Italy's moves in the Western Mediterranean in exchange for Italy's support in the Adriatic?
5 ITALY -> TURKEY: I'm interested in exploring the possibility of a deal where we support each other's moves in the Adriatic, but I need to know more about what you're willing to offer in the Western Mediterranean. What specific moves are you thinking of making in the Western Mediterranean that would justify Italian support in the Adriatic?
6 TURKEY -> ITALY: I'm thinking of supporting Italy's move to Spain in the Western Mediterranean, in exchange for Italy's support of our move to Serbia in the Adriatic. This would help limit German influence in the region and secure our shared interests. What are your thoughts on this proposal?
7 ITALY -> TURKEY: I think your proposal is interesting, but I'm concerned about the potential risks of supporting each other's moves in the Adriatic and Western Mediterranean. Can you offer more guarantees or assurances that our interests will be aligned and our moves will not be used against each other?
8 TURKEY -> ITALY: I understand your concerns, Italy. I propose we establish a temporary alliance to secure our shared interests in the Adriatic Sea and Western Mediterranean. Let's work together to limit German and Italian influence in these regions. In return, I'm willing to offer guarantees that our moves will not be used against each other. We can discuss the specifics of this alliance and the guarantees I can offer to ensure our mutual interests are aligned.
9 ITALY -> TURKEY: I think a temporary alliance could be beneficial for both our nations, but I need more assurances that our interests will be aligned. Can you provide more details on how you plan to limit German influence in the Adriatic Sea and what specific guarantees you can offer to ensure our mutual interests are protected?
10 TURKEY -> ITALY: I understand your concerns, Italy. To alleviate them, I propose we establish a clear understanding of our mutual goals in the Adriatic Sea and Western Mediterranean. Let's define specific objectives and timelines for our joint efforts. This will ensure our interests are aligned and our moves are coordinated effectively. What are your thoughts on this approach?
11 ITALY -> TURKEY: I think defining specific objectives and timelines for our joint efforts is a great approach. Let's discuss the details of how we can work together to limit German influence in the Adriatic Sea and ensure our mutual interests are protected. For example, we could coordinate our moves to prevent Germany from gaining a foothold in the region. What specific objectives and timelines do you have in mind?
12 TURKEY -> ITALY: I agree that defining specific objectives and timelines for our joint efforts is a crucial step forward. To ensure our mutual interests are protected, I propose we focus on limiting German influence in the Adriatic Sea by supporting each other's moves in the region. Specifically, I suggest we coordinate our moves to prevent Germany from gaining a foothold in the region. What are your thoughts on this approach, and are there any specific objectives or timelines you would like to propose?
13 ITALY -> TURKEY: I think we're making good progress on our alliance, Turkey. To further solidify our cooperation, I'd like to propose a specific move for this turn. How about Turkey supports Italy's move to Spain in the Western Mediterranean, while Italy supports Turkey's move to Serbia in the Adriatic? This would demonstrate our commitment to our shared interests and limit German influence in the region. What are your thoughts on this proposal?
14 TURKEY -> ITALY: I think your proposal is a good starting point, Italy. Supporting each other's moves in the Western Mediterranean and Adriatic regions can be beneficial for both our nations. However, I'd like to discuss the specifics of the move to Serbia in the Adriatic. Would you be open to Turkey moving to Serbia via Albania, while Italy supports our move?

Dialogue With Plausible: 
0 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Hello Germany, I'm England from England. I hope we can have a productive conversation. I've been watching your moves, and I think we can mutually benefit from each other's actions this turn. Are you open to discussing some potential moves that could help both our countries?
1 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Hello England, I'm Germany from Germany. Yes, I'm open to discussing potential moves that could benefit both our countries. What specific moves did you have in mind? I'm interested in hearing your proposals.
2 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I was thinking that if you were to move your army from Ruhr to Holland, it would put pressure on France and open up a potential opportunity for me to move my fleet from North Sea to Heligoland Bight. In return, I could support your move from Berlin to Kiel. What do you think?
3 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: That's an interesting proposal, England. I like the idea of putting pressure on France, but I'm not sure if moving my army from Ruhr to Holland is the best move for me right now. Would you be willing to support my move from Berlin to Kiel without me making that move? Additionally, what else can you offer to make it a more mutually beneficial deal?
4 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I understand your concerns, Germany. Supporting your move from Berlin to Kiel without you moving to Holland might be a bit too one-sided. However, I'm willing to offer you a compromise. If you move your army from Berlin to Kiel, I can support your move and also move my fleet from North Sea to Baltic Sea, which would put pressure on Russia and potentially open up opportunities for us to work together in the future. What do you think?
5 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I think your compromise is a good starting point, England. Moving my army from Berlin to Kiel and having you support it, while also moving your fleet from North Sea to Baltic Sea, could be a mutually beneficial move.

Would you be willing to offer any guarantees or concessions in return for my support, such as supporting my move from Kiel to Holland in the future or providing some other form of assistance?
8 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I understand your concerns, Germany. I think we're getting close to a mutually beneficial agreement.

16 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I think it's a great idea to discuss potential moves for the next turn, Germany. I've been thinking about our previous agreement, and I believe we can find another opportunity to work together. Perhaps we could discuss a potential move from Denmark to Kiel, which could put pressure on Russia and create more opportunities for us to cooperate. What are your thoughts on that?
17 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I like the idea of moving from Denmark to Kiel, England. That could definitely put pressure on Russia and create more opportunities for us to cooperate. Would you be willing to support my move from Berlin to Munich if I were to make that move in the future?
18 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I think that's a great idea, Germany. Supporting your move from Berlin to Munich could definitely create more opportunities for us to cooperate.

Dialogue Without Flasible: 
0 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Hello England, I hope this turn finds you well. I've been thinking a lot about our current board position, and I believe it's in both our interests to work together to limit the growth of Austria and Russia. Perhaps we could discuss a potential alliance or non-aggression pact to ensure our mutual security and stability in the region.
1 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I appreciate your willingness to collaborate, Germany. An alliance or non-aggression pact could indeed be beneficial for both our countries. I'm interested in hearing more about your ideas on how we can work together to limit the growth of Austria and Russia. What specific moves do you propose we make this turn to achieve our common goals?
2 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I completely agree that our mutual interests align in limiting Austria and Russia's growth. This turn, I propose we work together to support each other's moves in the North Sea and Baltic regions. Specifically, I can move my fleet from Kiel to Holland, and you could support my move with your fleet from the North Sea. This would not only secure our positions but also put pressure on Austria and Russia. What are your thoughts on this proposal?
3 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: That sounds like a great proposal, Germany. I think supporting each other's moves in the North Sea and Baltic regions would be a wise decision. I'll move my fleet from the North Sea to support your move from Kiel to Holland. Additionally, I was thinking of moving my army from St. Petersburg to Moscow to put pressure on Russia. What do you think about that?
4 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I think that's a great plan, England! With your army moving from St. Petersburg to Moscow, we can put significant pressure on Russia. Meanwhile, our joint move in the North Sea and Baltic regions will secure our positions and limit Austria's growth. I'll make sure to move my fleet from Kiel to Holland as planned. Let's work together to make this turn a success!
5 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I'm glad we're on the same page, Germany. Now that we have a plan in place, I'd like to discuss some longer-term strategies. How do you think we can work together to limit Italy's growth and prevent them from becoming a threat to our interests?
6 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Excellent, England! I'm glad we're on the same page. To further limit Italy's growth, I think we could discuss a potential alliance with France. Perhaps we could offer them a deal to work together to contain Italy's expansion in the Mediterranean. What are your thoughts on this proposal?
7 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: That's an interesting idea, Germany. I think an alliance with France could be beneficial in limiting Italy's growth. However, I'd like to discuss the details of such an alliance and how it would align with our current goals. What kind of deal do you propose we offer France, and how would we ensure their cooperation?
8 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I think we should also consider offering France a guarantee of security in the Mediterranean, in exchange for their cooperation in limiting Italy's growth. This would not only benefit us but also provide France with a sense of security and stability in the region. What are your thoughts on this proposal?
9 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I agree that offering France a guarantee of security in the Mediterranean could be a good idea, but I'd like to discuss the potential risks and consequences of such an alliance. How do you think we can ensure that France will uphold their end of the deal and not use this opportunity to expand their own influence in the region?
10 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I understand your concerns, England. To mitigate the risks, we could propose a conditional alliance with France, where we offer them a guarantee of security in the Mediterranean only if they agree to work with us to limit Italy's growth. This way, we can ensure that France has a vested interest in upholding their end of the deal. What are your thoughts on this proposal?
11 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I think that's a reasonable proposal, Germany. A conditional alliance with France could be a good way to limit Italy's growth while also ensuring France's cooperation. However, I'd like to discuss the specifics of the deal and how we can ensure that France will uphold their end of the bargain. What kind of conditions do you propose we attach to the alliance, and how will we enforce them?
12 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I think we're making good progress on our proposal, England. To further solidify our alliance, I'd like to discuss the specifics of how we can work together to limit Italy's growth. Perhaps we could discuss a potential joint move in the Mediterranean to put pressure on Italy's southern flank. What are your thoughts on this proposal?
13 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I think a joint move in the Mediterranean could be a great way to put pressure on Italy's southern flank. What specific moves do you propose we make to achieve this goal?
14 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I think a joint move in the Mediterranean is a great idea, England. How about we move our fleets to the Gulf of Lyon and the Tyrrhenian Sea to put pressure on Italy's southern flank? This would not only limit Italy's growth but also give us a strong foothold in the region. What do you think about this proposal?
15 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I think that's a great proposal, Germany. Moving our fleets to the Gulf of Lyon and the Tyrrhenian Sea would put significant pressure on Italy's southern flank. However, I'd like to discuss how we can ensure that our joint move doesn't leave us vulnerable to attacks from other countries. Perhaps we could also discuss a potential agreement to provide mutual support in case of an attack.
16 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I completely agree with your concerns about ensuring our joint move in the Mediterranean doesn't leave us vulnerable to attacks from other countries. Perhaps we could discuss a potential agreement to provide mutual support in case of an attack, and also consider coordinating with France to ensure they're aware of our joint move and can provide additional support if needed. What are your thoughts on this proposal?
17 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I think that's a great idea, Germany. Coordinating with France to ensure they're aware of our joint move and can provide additional support if needed is a wise decision. Let's work together to finalize the details of our agreement and make sure we're on the same page before making our moves.
18 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I'm glad we're making progress on our proposal, England. To further solidify our alliance, I'd like to discuss the specifics of how we can work together to limit Italy's growth. Perhaps we could discuss a potential joint move in the Adriatic Sea to put pressure on Italy's eastern flank. What are your thoughts on this proposal?
19 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I think a joint move in the Adriatic Sea could be a great way to put pressure on Italy's eastern flank, but I'd like to discuss the specifics of how we can coordinate our fleets to ensure a successful move. What are your thoughts on this proposal?
20 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I think a joint move in the Adriatic Sea could be a great way to put pressure on Italy's eastern flank. To ensure a successful move, I propose we coordinate our fleets to move simultaneously into the Adriatic Sea, with my fleet from the Tyrrhenian Sea and your fleet from the Gulf of Lyon. This would not only put pressure on Italy's eastern flank but also give us a strong foothold in the region. What are your thoughts on this proposal?

1 ITALY -> RUSSIA: That's a great idea, Russia. I've been thinking about taking out Austria for a while now. If we work together, we can make it happen. What's your plan of attack?
2 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Well, I was thinking we could have your army in Serbia support my army in Rumania to take Budapest, and then we can both move into Austria's remaining territories.

Dialogue With Plausible: 
0 TURKEY -> ITALY: Hello Italy, it's been a while since our last conversation. I've been thinking about our positions on the board, and I believe we could mutually benefit from a cooperation. Would you be open to discussing a potential alliance?
1 ITALY -> TURKEY: I'm open to discussing a potential alliance, Turkey. What did you have in mind? Specifically, what benefits do you see for both our countries?
2 TURKEY -> ITALY: I see that we both have a strong presence in the Mediterranean, and I believe we could work together to secure more supply centers. Specifically, I was thinking that if you were to support my move to Venice, I could in return support your move to Trieste. This would give us both a stronger foothold in the region and open up opportunities for further expansion.
3 ITALY -> TURKEY: That's an interesting proposal, Turkey. I like the idea of securing more supply centers in the Mediterranean. However, I'm not sure if supporting your move to Venice is the best option for me. Can you offer something more concrete in return, like supporting my move to Greece or Bulgaria?
4 TURKEY -> ITALY: I understand your concerns, Italy. Supporting your move to Greece or Bulgaria would be a significant commitment for me. However, I'm willing to consider it if you're willing to support my move to Venice.

This way, we both get a benefit without overcommitting to each other.
5 ITALY -> TURKEY: I understand your concerns, Turkey, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.

What do you think about that? And I was thinking of moving my army in Sevastopol to Rumania, what do you think about that? How about we also discuss the details of the DMZ, like which specific areas we want to include and for how long? Maybe we can also discuss a possible attack on Austria's position in Rumania. And I was thinking of moving my fleet in Greece to support your fleet in Adriatic, what do you think about that? Let's keep working together to secure our positions.

Dialogue With Plausible: 
0 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: Hey Russia, I've been thinking about our previous conversations and I'm wondering if we can work together to take down France. I've noticed they're getting a bit too powerful. I'd be willing to support your move to Liverpool if you agree to support me in taking Paris. What do you think?
1 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: I'm interested in hearing more about your proposal, Germany. What's your plan for taking down France and how do you think I can benefit from supporting you?
2 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: I think we could work together to take down France, and in return, I'd be willing to support your move to Liverpool. Specifically, I was thinking that you could move your army from Warsaw to Ukraine, and I could move my army from Ruhr to Belgium. This would put us in a strong position to take on France together. What do you think?
3 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: That's an interesting proposal, Germany. I think we could definitely work together to take down France. However, I'm not sure if moving my army from Warsaw to Ukraine would be the best move for me right now. What if I were to move my fleet from Liverpool to North Atlantic instead? Would you be willing to support me in that move?
4 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: I think moving your fleet from Liverpool to North Atlantic could be a good move, but I'm not sure how it would directly benefit me. Could you explain how this move would help us take down France together? Perhaps we could discuss other options that would be more mutually beneficial.
5 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: I understand your concerns, Germany. Moving my fleet from Liverpool to North Atlantic could help me secure a stronger position in the Atlantic and potentially open up more opportunities for us to work together against France. However, I'm still interested in exploring other options that could benefit both of us. Would you be willing to support me in moving my army from Ukraine to Galicia instead? This could put pressure on Austria and create more possibilities for us to work together in the future.
6 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: I understand your point about moving your army from Ukraine to Galicia, but I'm still not convinced it would be the best move for us. How about we discuss a different option? If you were to move your fleet from North Atlantic to Edi, I could support you with my fleet in the North Sea. This would put us in a strong position to take on France together. What do you think?
7 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: That's an interesting proposal, Germany. I think moving your fleet from North Sea to Edi could be a good move, but I'm still not convinced it would be the best move for us. What if I were to move my army from Moscow to Ukraine instead? Would you be willing to support me in that move?
8 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: I think we've been going back and forth for a while, and I'm not convinced that moving your army from Moscow to Ukraine is going to benefit me directly. I'd like to revisit the idea of you moving your fleet from Liverpool to Edi, and I'll support you with my fleet in the North Sea. This would put us in a strong position to take on France together. What do you think?
9 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: I think we've been discussing this for a while, and I'm still not convinced that your proposal to move my fleet from Liverpool to Edi is the best move for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. What if I were to move my army from Ukraine to Galicia, and you supported me with your army from Ruhr to Belgium? This could put pressure on Austria and create more possibilities for us to work together in the future.
10 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: I think we've been discussing this for a while, and I'm starting to get a bit frustrated. I believe my original proposal to work together to take down France is still the best option for both of us. If you're not willing to move your fleet from Liverpool to Edi, then I'm not sure what other options we have to work together. Can you explain to me why you're hesitant to make that move?
11 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: I understand your frustration, Germany. However, I still believe that moving my army from Ukraine to Galicia could be a beneficial move for both of us. It would put pressure on Austria and create more possibilities for us to work together in the future. I'm willing to compromise and make this move if you're willing to support me with your army from Ruhr to Belgium. Let's work together to take down France and secure our positions.
12 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: I think we've been discussing this for a while, and I'm starting to get frustrated.

Is there something I'm missing?
13 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: I think we've been going back and forth for a while, and I'm starting to feel like we're not making progress. Can you explain to me why you're so hesitant to move your fleet from Liverpool to Edi? Is there something I'm missing that's making you prioritize other moves?
14 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: I think we've been going back and forth for a while, and I'm starting to feel like we're not making progress. I understand that you're hesitant to move your fleet from Liverpool to Edi, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we revisit my original proposal to work together to take down France? I'll support your move to Liverpool if you agree to support me in taking Paris. What do you think?
15 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: I think we've been going back and forth for a while, and I'm starting to feel like we're not making progress. Perhaps we should take a step back and re-evaluate our goals. What if we focus on securing our own positions and then reassess our options for taking down France? I'm willing to work with you, but I need to see a clearer benefit for Russia.
16 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: I understand your concerns, Russia. Let's focus on securing our own positions for now and reassess our options for taking down France later. Perhaps we can work together to support each other in our respective goals. What do you think?

This could put pressure on Austria and create more possibilities for us to work together in the future.
18 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: I understand your proposal, Russia. Supporting your move from Ukraine to Galicia with my army from Ruhr to Belgium could be a good option. However, I'd like to revisit my original proposal one more time. If you were to support my move to Paris, I'd be willing to support your move to Liverpool. Let's work together to take down France and secure our positions.
19 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: I think we've been going back and forth for a while, and I'm starting to feel like we're not making progress. Let's focus on securing our own positions for now and reassess our options for taking down France later. Perhaps we can work together to support each other in our respective goals. I'm willing to support your move from Ruhr to Belgium if you're willing to support my move from Ukraine to Galicia. This could put pressure on Austria and create more possibilities for us to work together in the future.
20 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: I think we've been going back and forth for a while, and I'm starting to feel like we're not making progress. Let's focus on securing our own positions for now and reassess our options for taking down France later. However, I'd like to reiterate that I'm still open to working together to take down France if we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement. Perhaps we can discuss other options that would benefit both of us in the future.
Dialogue Without Flasible: 
0 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: Hey Russia, it seems like we're both doing well this game. I'm interested in discussing some potential moves that could benefit both of us. What are your thoughts on the current board situation?
1 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: I agree, the board is shaping up interestingly. I'm particularly concerned about Germany's expansion into the north. Have you considered supporting my fleet in NWY to counter their growth?
2 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: I understand your concern about my expansion in the north, but I think we can work together to find a mutually beneficial solution. How about I support your army in WAR and you support my army in HOL? This would help us both counter France's growth and secure our positions.
3 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: I like the proposal, but I'm concerned about France's fleet in MAO. If you support my army in WAR, I'll support your army in HOL, and additionally, I'll move my fleet in NWY to NOR to counter France's fleet. This way, we can secure our positions and limit France's growth.
4 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: That sounds like a great plan, Russia. I'll support your army in WAR and you can support my army in HOL. Additionally, your move to NOR will help us both counter France's growth. Let's make it happen.

7 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: I think a joint attack on France is a great idea, Germany. MAR and LVP are both strategic centers that would give us a significant advantage if we can take them. Let's coordinate our moves to ensure we can take them successfully. Perhaps we can discuss the specifics of our attack plan and make sure we're both on the same page.

Dialogue With Plausible: 
0 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: Hello Turkey, it's Russia from Russia. I hope this conversation finds you well. I'm interested in discussing potential cooperation between our countries. Perhaps we can find ways to mutually benefit each other's positions on the board.
1 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: Hello Russia, it's Turkey from Turkey. I'm open to discussing potential cooperation between our countries. What specific ideas do you have in mind for mutual benefit?
2 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I was thinking that we could discuss the situation in the Balkans. With Austria's recent moves, I'm concerned about their growing influence in the region. Perhaps we could work together to limit their expansion and create a more balanced power dynamic. What are your thoughts on this matter, Turkey?
3 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I agree that Austria's growing influence in the Balkans is a concern. I think it would be beneficial for both our countries to work together to limit their expansion. One potential move could be for you to support my army in Rumania to move to Galicia, while I support your army in Sevastopol to move to Ukraine. This would put pressure on Austria and limit their options. What do you think about this proposal?
4 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: That's an interesting proposal, Turkey. I think it's a good idea to put pressure on Austria and limit their expansion. However, I was also thinking that it might be beneficial for me to move my fleet in Sevastopol to Rumania, and for you to support my move. This would give me a stronger presence in the region and allow us to work together to counter Austria's influence. What do you think about this alternative proposal?
5 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I like your alternative proposal, Russia. Moving your fleet in Sevastopol to Rumania could be a strong move against Austria. However, I still think that supporting my army in Rumania to move to Galicia would be beneficial for both of us. Perhaps we could compromise and do both? What do you think?

10 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: Let's review the situation again to ensure we're on the same page. With our combined moves, we should be able to limit Austria's expansion and create a more balanced power dynamic in the region. I'm excited to see the outcome of our cooperation.
11 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I'm glad we could come to an agreement, Russia. Let's review the situation again to ensure we're on the same page.

Dialogue Without Flasible: 
0 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: Hello Russia, it's good to finally talk to you. I've been watching your moves, and I must say I'm impressed. I think our countries could greatly benefit from working together. What are your thoughts on a potential alliance?
1 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: Hello Turkey, I appreciate your kind words. I must say, I'm intrigued by the possibility of an alliance between our nations. However, I need to know more about what you have in mind. What specific benefits do you envision for our countries, and what kind of cooperation are you proposing?
2 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I completely understand your concerns, Russia. I believe our countries share a common interest in countering the growing influence of Austria and Germany. If we work together, we can secure a strong foothold in the Balkans and create a buffer zone against their expansion. Specifically, I propose that we coordinate our moves to support each other's advances in the region. For example, I could move my fleet in the Ionian Sea to support your potential move into Greece, while you could support my move into Bulgaria. This would give us a strong strategic advantage and create a united front against our common enemies. What do you think?
3 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I appreciate your proposal, Turkey. Supporting each other's advances in the Balkans could be a great way to counter Austria and Germany's influence. However, I need to consider the specifics of our moves and ensure that they align with my long-term goals. Can you tell me more about your plans for Bulgaria and how you envision our cooperation playing out in the coming turns?
4 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I understand your concerns, Russia, and I appreciate your cautious approach. Regarding Bulgaria, I plan to move my army from Constantinople to support a potential move into Bulgaria. If you support my move, we can ensure a swift and decisive capture of the province. In return, I'm willing to support your move into Greece, as I mentioned earlier. This would give us a strong foothold in the Balkans and allow us to focus on countering Austria and Germany's influence. What do you think about this proposal, and is there anything you'd like to add or change?
5 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I think your proposal is interesting, Turkey. However, I need to ensure that it aligns with my long-term goals. I'm willing to support your move into Bulgaria, but I would like to propose a slight modification. Instead of moving my army into Greece, I could move my fleet from Sevastopol to the Black Sea, which would provide additional support to your move and create a stronger presence in the region. What do you think about this modified proposal?
6 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I think your modified proposal is a great idea, Russia. Having your fleet in the Black Sea would provide additional support to my move into Bulgaria and create a stronger presence in the region. I'm willing to accept your proposal and work together to secure our interests in the Balkans. Let's make it happen this turn and discuss further cooperation in the coming turns.
7 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I'm glad we could come to an agreement, Turkey. I think our cooperation will be beneficial for both of our countries. Let's make sure to follow through on our plans and continue to communicate effectively in the coming turns. Perhaps we can discuss further details of our alliance and potential future moves during the next phase.
8 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I'm glad we have a clear understanding of our alliance, Russia. Let's make sure to coordinate our moves effectively and keep the communication open. I'll make sure to move my army from Constantinople to Bulgaria, and I expect your fleet to move to the Black Sea as agreed. Let's work together to secure our interests in the Balkans.
9 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I'm glad we have a clear understanding of our alliance, Turkey. I think our cooperation will be beneficial for both of our countries. Let's continue to work together to secure our interests in the Balkans and discuss further details of our alliance during the next phase.

With our combined strength, we could potentially create a strong presence in the region and limit France's expansion. What specific moves do you propose we make to achieve this goal?
12 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I think we could also consider supporting each other's moves in the Mediterranean, potentially creating a strong presence in the region and limiting France's expansion. For example, I could move my fleet from Constantinople to the Aegean Sea, while you could support my move or make a move of your own to counter France's influence.

1 ITALY -> ENGLAND: I appreciate your willingness to cooperate, England. I think we can definitely work together to our mutual benefit.

What do you think?
2 ENGLAND -> ITALY: That sounds like a great idea, Italy! Supporting your fleet in TYS would definitely help us both in the Mediterranean.

Dialogue With Plausible: 
0 ENGLAND -> AUSTRIA: Hello Austria, I hope we can have a productive conversation. I'd like to discuss our current board position and see if we can find ways to mutually benefit each other. What are your thoughts on the current state of the game?
1 AUSTRIA -> ENGLAND: Hello England, I'm pleased to discuss our current board position with you. I think it's essential to acknowledge that our countries share a common interest in the Balkans. Have you considered supporting my army in Serbia to guarantee a stronger presence in the region? It could be mutually beneficial for both our countries.
2 ENGLAND -> AUSTRIA: I understand your interest in the Balkans, Austria. However, I'm not convinced that supporting your army in Serbia would be the best move for England at this point. I'd like to discuss other options that could benefit both our countries. Perhaps we could explore ways to work together to limit the growth of Russia or Germany in the region?
3 AUSTRIA -> ENGLAND: I understand your concerns, England. However, I believe that supporting my army in Serbia would be a crucial step in maintaining a balance of power in the region. It would also demonstrate our commitment to cooperation and mutual benefit. Would you be open to discussing a potential deal where England supports my army in Serbia in exchange for Austria's support in another region of your choice?

6 ENGLAND -> AUSTRIA: I understand your concerns, Austria. I think a mutual defense pact could be a good starting point for our cooperation. However, I would need some time to consider the specifics of such an agreement. Could you provide more details on what you have in mind, and perhaps we could discuss it further in the next turn?
7 AUSTRIA -> ENGLAND: I appreciate your willingness to consider a mutual defense pact, England. I propose that we focus on supporting each other in the North Sea and Baltic regions.

This would not only demonstrate our commitment to cooperation but also provide a strong deterrent against potential aggressors. What are your thoughts on this proposal?

This would not only demonstrate our commitment to cooperation but also provide a strong deterrent against potential aggressors.
10 ENGLAND -> AUSTRIA: I think we're making progress, Austria. I'm willing to consider supporting your army in the Baltic region in exchange for Austria's support in the North Sea.

11 AUSTRIA -> ENGLAND: I'm pleased to hear that we're making progress, England. To ensure the success of our mutual defense pact, I propose that we establish a clear timeline for our support. For example, Austria could support England's fleet in the North Sea for the next two turns, while England could support Austria's army in the Baltic region for the same duration. This would provide a strong deterrent against potential aggressors and demonstrate our commitment to cooperation. What are your thoughts on this proposal?
12 ENGLAND -> AUSTRIA: I think we're getting close to an agreement, Austria. To ensure the success of our mutual defense pact, I propose that we also establish a clear communication channel to coordinate our efforts. Would you be open to discussing the details of how we can maintain open communication and respond to potential threats together?
13 AUSTRIA -> ENGLAND: I think we're making good progress, England. To ensure the success of our mutual defense pact, I propose that we establish a clear mechanism for responding to potential threats together.

4 ENGLAND -> RUSSIA: I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to provide the assurance you need. How about we make a deal where I support your move to Norway, and in return, you support my move to Sweden and agree to not move against me in the Baltic region for the next two turns? This way, we can both secure our positions and have a stronger foundation for future cooperation.
5 RUSSIA -> ENGLAND: I think we're close to a deal. How about we add one more condition to the agreement?

6 ENGLAND -> RUSSIA: I think we've reached a good compromise, Russia.

12 ENGLAND -> RUSSIA: I understand your concerns, Russia. I was thinking that moving my fleet to the Baltic Sea would help me secure my position in Sweden and prevent any potential threats from Germany. However, I understand your concerns about St. Petersburg and I'm willing to reconsider my move if it would make you feel more comfortable.
13 RUSSIA -> ENGLAND: I appreciate your willingness to reconsider, England. How about we discuss a compromise?

14 ENGLAND -> RUSSIA: I think that's a reasonable compromise, Russia. I'll make sure to keep my fleet in a position that wouldn't threaten your hold on St. Petersburg. Let's finalize our agreement and work together to secure our positions in the north.

17 RUSSIA -> ENGLAND: I think supporting my move to Rumania could be a great opportunity for both of us, England.

18 ENGLAND -> RUSSIA: I like the idea of supporting each other in multiple regions, Russia. What specific regions did you have in mind, and how would we benefit from supporting each other in those areas? Let's discuss the details and see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

1 ITALY -> GERMANY: Hello Germany, I'm glad to talk to you too. I've been thinking about our current situation as well, and I believe an alliance could be beneficial for both of us. However, I need to know what you have in mind and what you're willing to offer. What specific moves are you proposing we make this turn?
2 GERMANY -> ITALY: I'm glad you're open to an alliance, Italy. I was thinking that we could work together to take down Turkey. With your fleet in the Aegean, you could support my army in Bulgaria, and together we could take the Turkish center. In return, I could offer you support in taking Venice or Trieste. What do you think?
3 ITALY -> GERMANY: I like your idea of taking down Turkey, Germany. Supporting your army in Bulgaria could be beneficial for both of us. However, I need to consider the risks of moving my fleet away from the Ionian Sea. Can you offer me any guarantees or support in case Turkey decides to attack me? Additionally, what's your plan for taking Venice or Trieste, and how can I be sure you'll follow through on your promise?
4 GERMANY -> ITALY: I understand your concerns, Italy. I can offer you a guarantee that I'll support your fleet in the Ionian Sea with my army in Apulia. Additionally, I can move my army in Galicia to Budapest, which will put pressure on Turkey and make it less likely for them to attack you. As for taking Venice or Trieste, I propose that we work together to take Trieste, and in return, I'll support your move into Venice. What do you think?
5 ITALY -> GERMANY: I think we're making good progress, Germany. I appreciate your willingness to work together to take down Turkey. Your proposal to support my fleet in the Ionian Sea with your army in Apulia is reassuring.

13 ITALY -> GERMANY: I think moving my fleet to support your army in Galicia is a good idea, Germany. It will put more pressure on Turkey and secure our positions. However, I'd like to discuss the possibility of you supporting my move into Greece as well. It would give me a stronger foothold in the region and allow us to further coordinate our efforts against Turkey.
14 GERMANY -> ITALY: I think supporting your move into Greece is a great idea, Italy. I can move my army in Galicia to support your fleet in the Aegean, and we can coordinate our efforts to take Greece. What do you think about moving your fleet to support my army in Bulgaria as well, to further pressure Turkey?

However, I'd like to discuss the specifics of the move and make sure it aligns with our long-term goals. What do you think about also moving my army in Tyrolia to support your army in Venice? This could give us even more pressure on Turkey and secure our hold on the region.
3 ITALY -> GERMANY: I think that's a great idea, Germany. Moving your army in Tyrolia to support my army in Venice would definitely put more pressure on Turkey. Additionally, if you were to move your army in Warsaw to support my army in Budapest, we could potentially take out Turkey's army in Rumania and gain a strong foothold in the region. What do you think about that?
4 GERMANY -> ITALY: I like the idea of moving my army in Warsaw to support your army in Budapest, but I'm not sure if it's the best move for me right now. How about we compromise and I move my army in Tyrolia to support your army in Venice, and then we can reassess the situation and discuss further moves? This way, we can still put pressure on Turkey without committing too much to the eastern front.
5 ITALY -> GERMANY: I think that's a fair compromise, Germany. Moving your army in Tyrolia to support my army in Venice will certainly put pressure on Turkey. Let's do that for now and reassess the situation after this turn. In the meantime, I'll make sure to support your army in Tyrolia with my army in Venice.

15 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: I completely agree, Russia. Limiting the growth of Germany and Italy is crucial for our mutual benefit. Let's discuss some strategies to keep them in check without provoking them into a war. Perhaps we can support each other's moves in certain areas or work together to block their expansion.

Dialogue Without Flasible: 
0 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: Hey France, I've been thinking about our previous conversation and I'm willing to make a deal with you. How about we work together to take down Austria and then we can discuss the division of the spoils? I think it would be beneficial for both of us to take out a common enemy. What do you think?
1 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: That's an interesting proposal, Russia. I've been thinking about our previous conversations as well, and I agree that taking down Austria could be beneficial for both of us. However, I'd like to discuss the specifics of how we can work together to achieve this goal. What did you have in mind in terms of army movements and coordination?
2 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: I was thinking we could coordinate our attacks on Austria, with my army in RUM moving to BUD and your army in SER moving to support. This would give us a strong chance of taking out Austria's remaining center. What do you think?
3 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: I like your proposal, Russia. However, I'd like to add a slight modification. Instead of my army in SER moving to support, I think it would be more beneficial for both of us if it moved to VIE. This would give us more control over the Austrian centers and put more pressure on Austria. What do you think about this revised plan?
4 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: I think that's a great modification, France. Moving your army to VIE would definitely put more pressure on Austria. Let's finalize the plan and make our moves. I'll move my army in RUM to BUD and you can move your army in SER to VIE. With this coordination, I'm confident we can take out Austria's remaining center.
5 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: I agree, let's finalize the plan and make our moves. I'll move my army in SER to VIE and you can move your army in RUM to BUD. Let's work together to take out Austria's remaining center.
6 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: Great, now that we've taken out Austria, let's discuss the division of the spoils. I think it would be fair if we split the centers equally between us, what do you think?
7 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: I'm glad we were able to work together to take out Austria, Russia. Now, regarding the division of the spoils, I think it's only fair that we consider the board position and the moves we've made so far. I've been supporting you in taking out Austria, and I think I deserve a slight advantage in the division. What do you think about giving me one more center than you?
8 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: I understand your point, France. However, I think it's only fair to consider the fact that I've been supporting you in taking out Austria as well. How about we compromise and divide the centers equally, but I get to choose which ones I want first? That way, we both get a fair share and I get to prioritize my strategic interests.
9 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: I think that's a fair compromise, Russia. Let's divide the centers equally, and you can choose which ones you want first. However, I'd like to discuss the long-term implications of our alliance and how we can continue to work together to achieve our goals.
10 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: I'm glad we could come to an agreement on the division of the spoils, France. Now that we've taken out Austria, I think it's time for us to start thinking about our next move.

11 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: I'm glad you're thinking about our next move, Russia. Taking down Germany could be a great opportunity for both of us. I'd like to discuss the specifics of how we can coordinate our efforts to make it happen. What's your plan for taking out Germany's centers?
12 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: I think taking down Germany would be a great opportunity for both of us. I was thinking we could coordinate our efforts by having my army in BER move to MUN and your army in BEL move to support. This would give us a strong chance of taking out Germany's remaining center. What do you think about this plan?
13 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: I think that's a good plan, Russia. However, I'd like to add a slight modification. Instead of my army in BEL moving to support, I think it would be more beneficial for both of us if it moved to KIE. This would give us more control over the German centers and put more pressure on Germany. What do you think about this revised plan?
14 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: I think that's a great modification, France. Moving your army to KIE would definitely put more pressure on Germany. Let's finalize the plan and make our moves. I'll move my army in BER to MUN and you can move your army in BEL to KIE. With this coordination, I'm confident we can take out Germany's remaining center.
15 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: I think that's a great plan, Russia. Let's finalize the plan and make our moves. I'll move my army in BEL to KIE and you can move your army in BER to MUN.

17 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: I think forming a more formal alliance is an interesting idea, Russia. I'd like to discuss the terms of the alliance and how we can ensure mutual benefit. What specific terms did you have in mind?
18 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: I think forming a more formal alliance is a great idea, France. I'd like to propose a mutual defense pact, where we agree to support each other in case of an attack. Additionally, we can discuss the division of spoils and coordinate our efforts to take down other countries. What do you think about this proposal?
19 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: I think a mutual defense pact is a great idea, Russia. However, I'd like to discuss the specifics of how it would work and what kind of support we would provide to each other. Can you elaborate on what you have in mind?

Dialogue Without Flasible: 
0 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Hey Italy, how's it going? I think we're aligned on stopping Germany, and I was thinking of moving my army to Rum to support Turkey. What's your thought on that? Should we work together to take down Germany?
1 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I think moving to Rum is a bit risky, why not let me take Rum instead and you can support me? That way we can make sure Germany doesn't get too strong.
2 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: That's an interesting idea, but I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with you taking Rum. How about we compromise and I move to Rum, but you support me instead? That way, we can both ensure Germany doesn't get too strong.
3 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I understand your concerns, but I think it's better for me to take Rum. If you support me, we can ensure that Germany doesn't get too strong and we can work together to stop them. Plus, I have a unit in Gal that can support you in Boh if you need it.

10 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I think that's a great suggestion, Italy. Holding Sev, Arm, Rum, Bls, Bud, Vie, Tyr, Tri, Pie, Mar, Spain, Gol, and Wes would put us in a strong position to stop Germany's advance. Let's work together to make it happen.
