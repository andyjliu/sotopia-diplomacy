I'm thinking you can move F Rumania - Black Sea this turn and convoy A Constantinople - Sevastopol next turn. Meanwhile, I'd appreciate it if you could move Budapest north through Galicia. I'll have to keep armies in the vicinity of the Adriatic Sea until we deal with Austria, but I can move A Venice - Tyrolia to prepare for Munich, and take Serbia this turn with Trieste. I'd like to keep Bulgaria and Smyrna around until next year-- I'm thinking that after the convoy, we can disband that fleet and convert it to an army. These are my thoughts, anyway-- what do you think?\r\n1 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Um... I think if your keeping all of your units around the Adriatic Sea on the border as well as your only two units not around the Adriatic I would rather demilitarise next year.\r\n2 ITALY -> RUSSIA: No problem. How do you feel about the Munich move?\r\n3 RUSSIA -> ITALY: That's fine I guess, let's finish Germany quick, France is helping him now.\r\n4 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Perhaps I could move Rumania to Bulgaria, then with Bulgaria to Serbia you could destroy my fleet with Greece in the fall.\r\n5 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Very good idea. I like it.\r\n6 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Alright sounds good.\n\nI'd really appretiate it if you could start putting some pressure on France.\r\n7 ITALY -> RUSSIA: I'd like that as well, personally-- taking as many French Scs as I can is going to be the strongest way that I can catch up. Unfortunately, that Austrian fleet is going to prevent me from doing anything about it until next year.\r\n8 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Right, well my expansion is about to come to an end, then I'll just be sitting around for years while you kill France.\r\n9 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Do you have an alternate suggestion? My paralysis is primarily due to a lack of good ideas this time around, given how crippling that Austrian fleet move is.\r\n10 RUSSIA -> ITALY: No no waitings fine by me, I think this game has gone very well, Our alliance has been completely successful.\r\n11 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Oh! I thought you were grumbling about waiting. In that case, thanks tremendously!\n\nI'm realising now that disbanding the fleet by dislodging from Bulgaria won't work, at least not this year. I'll need Bulgaria to stay in Serbia to pick it up in the fall, and Trieste can't do the job unless Austria doesn't move into the Adriatic. Offhand I'm inclined to say that we can disband it next year, but let's see where Austria finally moves, since many of our moves will be determined that way.\r\n",

You certainly don't need another fleet to take Edinburgh, Liverpool and Denmark.\n\nMeanwhile, you can see that I've built new fleets for attacking Italy.\r\n1 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: I build it to defend norway, honest. With Lvp and Edi, i can't cover sweden and norway... i'll keep the fleets on my side of the North Sea, swear!\n\nAlso after the disband, I take it the logic doesn't hold? I'll support Munich to Kiel\r\n2 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: if you really like when this is all done i can sail a helpless little fleet over near yours and you can disband it. its a bit risky but if you figure out a way, i'm willing\r\n3 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: You have a point about Norway. I didn't realize that. Sorry for the undue suspicion.\n\nYeah, I'd say Munich-kiel is in order.\r\n4 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: Wait, assuming he support-holds at Denmark. Then it won't work. You could hit Sweden, but then you wouldn't be able to protect Norway.\r\n5 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: &hit Denmark. With Sweden.\r\n6 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: well nothing wrong w/ a little suspicion. this is diplomacy after all! for the record, can we agree that neither of us crosses the line that runs ont he eastern borders of kiel and munich (and the south of munich)? i'll order support to kiel, no point with a support hold anyways. it'll all fall eventually, just a matter of time\r\n7 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: Fair enough. Guess there's nothing else for you to do with that army anyway. And yeah, I'll agree not to cross that line (until there comes a time when we're both plowing through Italy, of course).\n\nAlso, I will be attacking Italy this turn.\r\n8 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: thanks... he's pretty solidly installed out east huh? and im overcommited in the north now that i think about it... i need something move down south... hmm.\r\n9 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: Yeah, I was thinking about the same. I think it'll work out after this year though, as you'll be getting two builds. Armies at Warsaw and Moscow. Meanwhile, Italy won't be able to get through your defenses because he'll have to deal with my surprise attack.\r\n10 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: Also, I'm wondering where Turkey stands in all this. Any idea what's going on with him?\r\n11 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: i dont know. you don't really get peoples' full intentions until they start hitting that 7-10 SC range you know?\r\n12 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: Er, not quite sure what you mean actually. You're saying Turkey is ignoring you because he's not that powerful?\r\n13 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: well i mean if he intends to attack me eventually, i really can't find out until he's got some of the balkans... whether i intend to attack him, i won't say even if i did. but i'm sure he just intends to get serbia etc. what every turkey does.\r\n14 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: Right. But I just mean....well, you helped him out with Serbia before. Italy helped Austria with Greece against him. Just curious what you expect from him. Are you on friendly terms? You sound like you expect him to attack you. Just trying to see the big picture here of how this is going to go down.\r\n15 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: who knows... sorry man i'm out of town basically playing by the seat of my pants here turning in moves just in time... sometimes. we're on friendly terms atm, yes\r\n16 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: Got it.

Thanks for the support into Bul, the Turk's days are certainly numbered, which will allow us to dedicate our full attention to the German, which we will need if we can't get the Englishman to flop. I can't imagine a unit not covering Berlin, but that's what we wanted, Germany having to worry about his home supply centers and not pushing east, so that worked well even though an army in Prussia is not ideal. Maybe the German is trying to make up with the Frenchman by leaving Bur? Anyway, interesting season, nice work and thanks again for help with Bul!\r\n1 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: FYI - I'll be out most of the day, but will check in before going to bed tonight.\r\n2 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: Yes, I think GER is trying to work with both ENG and FRA. Hopefully it won't work if there's a firm from against him from the East, so he can't scare them, which I'd expect is Eng's main motivation.\r\n3 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: What happened with Italy? He moved on FRA (which is good for GER)? And what about the move to TRI, was this prearranged?\r\n4 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: The German's size will give him power, people may take the \"if you can't beat him, join him\" approach, but I agree if the two of us stay strong against him it will give others the extra motivation to oppose him as well. I think the Italian was nervous the F/G was hiding their alliance and that France would slip into North Africa and West Med last season, though the move on Pie was pretty aggressive. I can't really figure out where the Italian's brain is it, which started when he took Tyrolia early on, but I didn't really want to send Budapest at him without saying something first, so I ended up telling him that since he was in Ven I was nervous and would be going to Trieste, he ended up bouncing me out, obviously. Anyway, I guess he trusts me enough to leave Smy on its own so that's something.\n\nAnyway, what do you want Sil to do now? Mun and Pru may bounce in Berlin, so I could support Prussia to Berlin? How do you want to handle Turkey, just sit and hold and wait for him to lose a unit or try to grab Con too? I'm typically a pretty patient guy, so sitting and holding works great for me, but if you want to get more aggressive this season so you can focus on the north, I'm sure we could come up with something. Like, if you wanted to try to get a build we could get risky and have Aeg and Smy support Bul to Con while Greece supports Rum to Bul and Sev hits Black Sea, since I can't imagine Black Sea attacking Rum (it would be open, Bud plans to attack Trieste again). I'm a go with the flow kind of guy, so it's totally your call, especially since the risk will be yours.\n\nThat's all I got! Let me know what you think, I'm pretty much up for whatever you're comfortable with and we've got options.\r\n5 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I like the plan about TUR, taking him out faster is good in any case, so if you see a chance to take CON I'm in. Just tell me if you need me to move to BS and BUL.\n\nAs for GER, I actually expect him to move RUHR-MUN and MUN-BER, while PRU will continue to LIV probably. I don't really see what can be done with the current units, looks like the most reasonable thing to do is St.p-liv with support from WAR and Bar-st.p.? This way at least there's a wall from SIL to St.p.\n\nPlus, if I do get a get a build in the South I will be able to place in MOS, or if he bounced me, even in St.p. This is the only thing that comes to mind.\n\nIf you can somehow get IT and FRA to take TYR and BUR this will make it much better though.\r\n6 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: Okay, Smy will support Bul to Con, so if Sev attacks Black Sea and Greece supports Rum to Bul, we'll be in great shape, especially since you could really use that army in Mos you speak of! Ultimately we won't be able to keep Stp in your possession if Germany keeps pushing, but we should be able to limit the damage there and wait for England to flop over to work with France against Germany.\n\nWe really need to get England to flop, maybe he'll work with France to take Belgium while Ruh heads to Mun? I do like the idea of War supporting Stp to Liv while Barents covering Stp, not sure what else can be done.\n\nI'd like to tell you I talked I and F to take Tyr and Bur, but I'm pretty sure they're planning that already with minimal input from me! ;-)\n\nPS - Poor German, nothing like having a three center lead in a game of this magnitude only to be one of the first eliminated, bad time to learn the lesson of the tall poppy syndrome... though if he hasn't learned it by now, it's really our obligation to teach the young lad!! :-)\r\n7 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: Good night!\r\n8 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: Ok, brilliant.\n\nI am talking with ENG, he seems to have decided to change course, maybe will try to snatch HOL or DEN this turn.\n\nI will try to keep St.p. for as long as possible, being unable to place in the North is a huge limitation. Nothing is lost there.\r\n9 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: Great, thanks for the confirmation, should be a good season for us!\r\n10 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: ok :)\r\n",

All his other neighbors want him dead . ..\r\n11 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: yes it is true, the german does not have much choice, but still he is a pleasant fellow to be allied with, so i hope i can get him off the hook somehow.\r\n",

If France also takes Belgium, he becomes extremely dangerous in his safe corner. I, on the other hand, have a strong A/T that will only come after you once I'm gone, it makes sense for you to keep me as a buffer of the A/T as long as possible, right? Anyway, if you tap EC I can take Belgium back, let me know if you're up for it!\r\n1 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Hmmm. I was quite happily working with you before you stabbed me. Give me Sweden back (let me move in there this year) and I'll work with you. If not, you get attacked from every direction and die. Simple choice, really.\r\n2 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: How about Belgium instead of Sweden?\r\n3 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Thing about Belgium is that it's right in between you and France, and should the pendulum then change again, I'm back on the defensive. I prefer Sweden. I'm fine with you having the whole of France, if I get Spain/Portugal.\n\nSeem fair and that I'm not trying to surround you?\r\n4 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: To me, if you have Scandinavia, your home land (obviously!) and Iberia, then you are surrounding me. Ideally, I'd like to eventually have all of Scandinavia and Stp while you have all of France and Iberia, then neither of us is surrounding the other. How we get there, I'm not sure...\r\n5 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Well, if you insist on Sweden, what if you tap (or support an attack on) English Channel so I can take Belgium as I push west at France?\r\n6 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Sweden has to go to me for me to consider it. I don't see why you're so worried about me possibly surrounding you though, there's no way either of us, or France, can solo this game now.\r\n7 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Okay, but will you attack EC in exchange for Sweden, so I can take Bel back?\r\n8 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I'm not sure. I'd quite like you to disband that Baltic fleet. I won't be attacking Holland/Denmark though.\r\n9 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: What kind of deal is that, I give you Den, France takes Belgium, what about me, how do I fit in? If that's the deal I'd just as soon suicide against you, make sure France gets Hol and Munich, while I use everything to defend Scandinavia, use my fleets to support France into North Sea and take you down with me, right? If you don't want to work with me, that's cool, but don't expect me to give my centers away for nothing in return, I do have a bit of pride and am not afraid to die for what I believe in.\r\n10 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Interesting. I'm sure you can see why i don't trust you though.\r\n11 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: If I attack EC and you don't give me Belgium, I screw myself over.\r\n12 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: &Sweden\r\n13 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Lets see. I attack EC, you attack Belgium from Ruhr? If you attack from Holland, youj might get cut by the Burgundy army.\r\n14 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Trust is relative. Why should I trust you more than you trust me? It's a game, sometimes you have to make a move to balance things. I'm a great ally if I get a little comfort and have a plan in place for me and my ally to expand in a logic direction that doesn't include one surrounding the other, especially if it is me being surrounded! ;-)\n\nYes, you attack EC, I take Bel from Ruhr, you get Sweden. Think on it and let me know, I'm game if you are! :-)\r\n15 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Alright, lets go for it.\r\n16 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: EXCELLENT!!!!\n\nYou won't regret it!!!! =)\r\n",

Want to try supporting Holland into NTH with ENG while England bounces himself in London? I could then support you into London. Just one idea, and I look forward to hearing from you again.\r\n1 FRANCE -> GERMANY: Here is an idea how to deal with Burgundy.\n\nPlease support Mar-bur with Ruhr and move Bel-pic. I will use Channel to bounce you in Pic and that will remove Pic as a retreat option for him. We will destroy his army there.\r\n2 GERMANY -> FRANCE: He can still retreat to Gascony; do you also plan to move Bre - Gas?\r\n3 GERMANY -> FRANCE: You'd also want to move Gol to Marseilles to keep Italy out, but you probably planned that already.\r\n4 FRANCE -> GERMANY: [190899] my mind :)\r\n5 FRANCE -> GERMANY: You should be able to take North Sea with your two fleets anyways.\n\nAlso you are moving Kiel-baltic?\r\n6 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Not sure about Kiel-baltic yet; I'm concerned that NTH retreating to Hel could wreak havoc in Holland, Kiel and Denmark so I'm not sure how I'll handle that yet.\r\n7 FRANCE -> GERMANY: Ok but we are in agreement for the original deal of killing Burgundy army?\r\n8 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Regarding Gas--i think you should keep the fleet in Brest this turn in case England supports himself into the Channel. Might I suggest Paris bouncing with Brest in Gascony? Combined with our bounce in Pic and my support for Mar into Bur, it'd force the disband and you wouldn't sacrifice position.\r\n9 FRANCE -> GERMANY: Yeah I think that is the best option. I will bounce myself in Gal and move Mar-bur. Along with Channel bouncing in Picardy with your army in Belgium.\r\n10 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Excellent. I'll set it up.\r\n11 FRANCE -> GERMANY: Actually can you support Paris-burgundy. I will be using Mar to self bounce in Gas.\r\n12 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Easy enough; I will do that instead.\r\n13 GERMANY -> FRANCE: We should definitely see if we can get on England's good side--individually, of course--to see if we can find out what he'll move and end him more quickly. However, I don't think after taking his Scs that he'll particularly want to work with me, so you may be better equipped to find out. Let me know if you can get on England's good side diplomatically.\r\n14 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I am trying but the most I can get from him is request for support into Belgium with my Channel fleet.\n\nI told him odds of that succeeding are slim but I will do it. Obviously I wont but at least we know where we stand.\r\n15 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Awesome. He might attempt that, but I've got more than enough support holds to prevent him from taking it--if you're OK with us not bouncing in Picardy. I'll support Paris to Burgundy, you'll bounce in Gas, and that should disband England's Burgundy army. Any last-minute suggestions or ideas?\r\n16 FRANCE -> GERMANY: No problem. Lets just kill his army on the mainland and force him to fully defend his island.\r\n17 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Perfect. I'm all locked in: Munich and Belgium support Paris to Burgundy.\r\n",

That is exactly what you are seeing in this game.\n\nEngland on the other hand, interestingly enough, has my highest winning percentage. I just follow a simple formula of stab one, then the other. Its impossible to push past St Petes anyway, so its really just a question of timing.\r\n4 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: interesting. i don't know who i've won most with, and haven't had that many solos anyway, so it'd be hard to say.\r\n5 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: absolutely agreed about turkey, i got a solo with turkey a little while ago, shocklingly, but similar to how you did it - getting lackeys to help. everyone kept saying \"how come everyone is helping you win\" and i was just smiling =)\r\n6 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: england i have played soooo much in the last 2 months on here, seems like i've gotten it like 10 times in a row. i haven't found it to be easy to solo, but am about to in my final league game, i hope, as england.\r\n7 TURKEY -> ENGLAND: Thats probably because you didn't play it much before, and the new system is correcting it. The reason you don't have alot of solos is because you joined after /draw was implemented, which increased the draws exponentially.\n\nConcerning solos, during Sow I encouraged students to count 18 centres that they need to win. Then do it without using and centres of their current ally. Its difficult. Lets try shall we? In addition to your current centres you need: Munich, Berlin, Warsaw, St Petes, Moscow, Sevastapol, Vienna, Trieste, Budapest, Venice, Rumania. Kind of ridiculous don't you think?\n\nRealistically you will get St Petes and Berlin, but thats it. Just sayin'. Winners play to win.\r\n8 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: at this point if i turn on france, i give you the win.\r\n9 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: i always count the Scs, and i do play to win. but i also play to keep others from winning.\r\n10 TURKEY -> ENGLAND: No. If you do it later you give me the win. I'm giving you a fighting chance. The longer you wait, the less chance you are going to do it, because I'm just eating up centres over here. Get Italy to stab me or something. That should keep me busy.\r\n11 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: b/c the fact is, i'd rather participate in a draw than lose. i also don't want a reputation as someone that always stabs, i'm fine with people thinking that i am untrustworthy at times, but not that i won't ever keep my word, which is how some folks play for sure.\r\n12 TURKEY -> ENGLAND: You are right that if you don't stab France (and France doesn't stab you) I will probably not win by myself. I will plod away for as long as humanly possible though, because I can, and thats just no fun. Racing to the finish is fun though.\r\n13 TURKEY -> ENGLAND: I break my word all the time and yet still I find allies. Its a diplomacy miracle.\r\n14 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: not really, you can destroy italy quite quickly.\r\n15 TURKEY -> ENGLAND: Not if he stabs me first! Look how open I'm leaving myself! I'm totally moving Serbia to Budapest this turn. Promise.\r\n16 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: i mean, it's not like i don't stab people, obviously i do. but i try to also to keep my word, you know.\r\n17 TURKEY -> ENGLAND: Sure. But really, say you stab France and I'm pushing for a win. (My 18th is a stretch, probably Marseilles or Spain) Do you keep fighting France? I'm going to go with no.\n\nAnyways, its not all that important. It just seems like this game is a bit of a foregone conclusion.\r\n18 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: right, it's true. i think i am too cautious sometimes, but it's ok. i wouldn't mind clearing a game off my plate quickly here with the masters tournament starting.\r\n19 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: on the other hand, while i do have 2 fewer solos than you, but we have the same number of draws, and then the rest of the discrepancy between our records is the greater times you've been defeated or survived. so i guess i'm doing something right.\r\n20 TURKEY -> ENGLAND: Hahaha thats true. You are ranked higher than me. But most of theose suries are from [165241] no draw time last year. I also used to be really bad. Or to put it nicer, have been getting better. So lets not go for my jugular just yet.\r\n21 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: lol\n\nyeah, [165241] really messes with that, and i can only imagine the lack of a draw option did too.\r\n22 TURKEY -> ENGLAND: Technically you could draw, you just needed to ask Kestas to do it manually on the forum, which not only slowed it down, but invited \"purists\" to comment that drawing without a stalemate line is heresy.\r\n",

Nice try. You could easily hold a line at Tys and Tunis & this is indisputable. I know what you're trying to do, but please don't try it. You know very well that conquering Russia will be very easy; I suggest you take this route.\r\n9 ITALY -> ENGLAND: You give me too much credit I wasnt &trying& anything... I was just trying to secure my borders... how about I dont move west of Tyrrhenian but you only station armies in spain/marsielle?\r\n10 ENGLAND -> ITALY: Okay, that sounds good to me, though I may put a fleet on the North Coast of Spain, but that doesn't really affect you. Also, I'm not giving you too much credit, that's what it appears like you're doing...\r\n11 ITALY -> ENGLAND: A north coast fleet would be good also... on the credit issue fair enough, the appearences were decieving then\r\n12 ENGLAND -> ITALY: Okay, glad that was cleared up.\r\n",

I was wondering whether you can support hold Mars with Gol and support hold Tunis with Ionian?\n\nI was thinking about support moving Tyrr to Western Med. The little hitch I'm not familiar with/don't really know is whether W.med would cuts Gol support if I'm moving there with Tyrr?\n\nBecause France seems like he will, without a doubt, reclaim Mars at the moment.\r\n1 ITALY -> TURKEY: Unless maybe if you wanna support move Mars to Spain with Gol. I'm just not sure whether that would work either, haha.\r\n2 ITALY -> TURKEY: Although this is what I received from France - I figured I'd run it by you.\n\nFrance:\nTurkey/Italy is a bit unconventional, but I have seen it work. You and Turkey together can control the board now and basically draw with whichever third party you choose.\n\nI'd like to finish in the draw if possible. I can be useful in containing England, and I'd be happy to cede my territory to you and live on in a small way in, let's say, Liverpool and London.\n\nBasically, if you and Turkey will allow me to be the third party to your draw, I will make myself useful in any way possible. I prostrate myself before you and plead for mercy! :)\r\n3 ITALY -> TURKEY: I wouldn't mind at all going T-R-F. France has agreed to allow me to keep Mars if this were the case. Then I'd mostly be focused on Germany and perhaps helping France against England where I can.\nHowever, it may mean some army builds in Venice - not to go in your direction, but rather to get into Germany, etc.\nLet me know if you're down for it. Also, sorry, hahaha. I think over the course of this game, I realized I'm a rather needy ally. Thank you very much for dealing with this chaos.\r\n4 TURKEY -> ITALY: Yeah, I think I need help haha. It's taking over my life\r\n5 TURKEY -> ITALY: You forgot to move your armies... it's fine if you did it on purpose cause you didn't trust me. You don't have to lie to me :)\r\n6 TURKEY -> ITALY: I'm fine with France being a third party to our alliance as long as it's useful to us. I'm supporting Mar and Tun holds anyway\r\n7 ITALY -> TURKEY: Lmao, no, no, I really did forget. If I didn't trust you, I probably should've support held them. So it's dumb in either case, hahah. I sometimes save my moves and forget about the time and boom. Dude, 6 games is... just... are you okay? Hahaha, okay. D'you have a Country you prefer to play as? I'm somewhat curious what you'd characterize your play style as & I'm new ish to the game, obviously, and have a slew of questions regarding the ethics of lying in-game. I'm close to writing up a paper on it all to figure everything out, not even joking, so maybe you're not the only one who needs help.\nEasy. I wanna see if we can get rid of England/weaken him, since he's the only real threat to our alliance currently and we do want to contain. If we throw France to the dogs right now, England could end up taking a decent chunk outta him.\r\n8 ITALY -> TURKEY: Although in all honesty, I'm a little nervous this move, haha. I know we have a nice alliance going.HOWEVER, I also feel like stabs tend take place pre-builds. And then it's like \"aha, now you're 3 units down suck it.\" So whenever pre-build rolls around and I have any areas exposed, I'm automatically sweating hell outta my palms, haha.\r\n9 TURKEY -> ITALY: Does \"easy\" mean don't support Mar and Tun?\r\n10 TURKEY -> ITALY: I'm not stabbing you. If I were going to stab you I would have done it already\r\n11 TURKEY -> ITALY: Unpopular opinion: I like playing England and Italy. You get to be a little more relaxed as France because your odds are a little better. But I guess I like the naval play or something.\r\n12 ITALY -> TURKEY: Hahah, you know what, supporting Mar and Tun might still be good. Just in case.\nThanks for the reassurance!!\r\n13 ITALY -> TURKEY: I confess, playing France-england-germany has been something of a headache - trying to pick and choose between the other two to ally with is nightmare fuel. Though I guess Turkey-austria-russia has a similar issue, and I've just had more luck with those countries. Austria's a soft spot of mine since that's the first country I ever played.\r\n14 TURKEY -> ITALY: I hate opening as Austria. Much too stressful and easy to become a target. Still, it's a fun power once you get past that\r\n15 ITALY -> TURKEY: True. I have done my fair share of stabs on Austria. And the last time I played as Austria, I was cursed with a very indecisive Italy - it depends quite heavily on the players in the surrounding nations for sure.\r\n16 ITALY -> TURKEY: I'm trying to make an ever elusive France-italy alliance maybe work in another game, hahah. It's a mission.\r\n",

The fleets you have facing me has made me worried, but so too with his armies\r\n1 ITALY -> TURKEY: So, what concretely do you think we should do here about Russia? Depending on his moves I can oust him from Budapest, I should think, but you'll want to do something about Ankara. Our fleets are definitely pointed at each other, which is really my fault. Still, your general point about Russia is a very good one.\r\n2 ITALY -> TURKEY: Let me know how you want to proceed. I'm thinking of having us head north. I'm sorry if I beat you out in Greece here.\r\n3 TURKEY -> ITALY: Russia is certainly the more imminent concern than Greece. Seems to be a guessing game with Budapest & he'll either cover Vienna, leaving Budapest vulnerable, or double down on Budapest leaving Vienna open. At the moment that seems like a 50/50 to me unless you have any insight into his thinking. I would love to help with Rum & the Balkans but first must cover Ankara, and perhaps self-bounce in Con? If you hear anything about Russia's tactics that would certainly help me \"get lucky\" with my guesses and while I don't expect him to open up to me I will pass on information in a similar fashion.\r\n4 ITALY -> TURKEY: well, not surprisingly I have some decent notions of what Russia is up to so a surprise attack on Budapest is likly to work. However, I'd think that a self bounce in constantinople isn't as likely to work as acutally taking Constantinople so we have a shot at taking Black sea, which is critical to making progress against Russia, isn't it?\r\n5 TURKEY -> ITALY: True, true. So you would be hitting Budapest with Trieste and Serbia & could Greece then support Bulgaria in case Russia tries to slide Rumania further south?\r\n6 ITALY -> TURKEY: Roughly, yes, that's the plan. I can support Bulgaria.\r\n7 TURKEY -> ITALY: Okay. I could also hit Rumania with Bul if it seems like Vienna will be open & Tri-vie, Ser S Bul-rum could put him two centers down AND crucially disband a fleet.\r\n8 ITALY -> TURKEY: I am trying to find out what he will do. Attacking Rumania is appealing to be sure\r\n9 TURKEY -> ITALY: I will support Serbia to Rumania. Sorry this news comes so late.\r\n10 TURKEY -> ITALY: Wait that's all wrong. I would like support into Rumania, if I do not here from you I will probably just support Serbia.\r\n11 TURKEY -> ITALY: hear&\r\n12 ITALY -> TURKEY: Yes, Serbia will support you into Romania\r\n13 TURKEY -> ITALY: Nice. I am hoping Russia gets greedy and shoots for Ankara, in which case this could knock out a fleet.\r\n",

He will still have EC/Pic/NS and it will be hard to me to hold Bel and Brest if I take it on the Spring turn.\nSo, I think our best shot is pretend we are still fighting and I make my move on the Fall.\nI wil try to figure out England moves and will return to you.\r\n3 ITALY -> FRANCE: yes you may be right: a fall move may be better as the spring move would lead england to retaliate in fall and you may well lose brest then, while if you wait for autumn it is a sure gain\nPlease suggest me moves we could play that are relatively safe for the two of us and give still the impression that you and I are fighting\r\n4 ITALY -> FRANCE: could you send a message to germany? he is worried that you do not talk to him\nAnd what moves should we play? the deadline is approaching\r\n5 FRANCE -> ITALY: I think on this turn the best choice is to fake an attack to Bur, that will bounce if Germany supports you and you take Spa with Gol, so in the Fall I can take Bre and you can be on MAO.\r\n6 ITALY -> FRANCE: ok agreed, I'll do these moves! good luck, I hope our alliance will work this time!\r\n7 ITALY -> FRANCE: just a precision: i will go for spain as agreed, but i will also hit gas so that marseilles is not at risk as a matter of precaution\r\n8 FRANCE -> ITALY: Humm, if you move Bur to Gas with Mars support we will end exchanging Bur and Gas and it could be a problem (at least to me).\r\n9 ITALY -> FRANCE: I think it is not a problem if you move [583807] to burgundy with paris support, then our two moves bounce\nthe other option is that spain hits marseilles to cut support\nor spain could support hold [583807]\r\n10 FRANCE -> ITALY: Humm, will think about. My problem now is setting the moves in a way England don&t get suspicious.\nSeems Germany wants to reopen conversations too, maybe it could be usefull.\r\n11 ITALY -> FRANCE: yes, I have told germany that you are one of the good guys now and that he should be nice with you ;)\r\n12 FRANCE -> ITALY: Well, England is supporting Spa, so if you don&t use Mars to support Gol into Spa it won&t work.\r\n",

That last one wasn't even a rant... to the contrary, while perhaps still somewhat icy, I feel like it was rather far removed from the sort of dialogue you were so turned off by before. And the response has been... silence.\n\nI suppose it's just as well. Truthfully, I'm not sure what I even have to offer you at this point and quite honestly I was even less so inclined to make whatever offer I could. I am curious as to your answers, but they are ultimately not urgent matters to attend.\r\n1 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Well if you'd like answers:\n\nA Naples indicates a lepanto clearly. A Ven is nebulous in it's intent. Although I'll grant you that a lepanto didn't even occur to me. If we were talking I might have thought of it, or you might have said something.\n\n\"Then we had the miscommunication breakdown and I switched to an attack. The fact that I had to spell that out for you is ample indication that I'm not the one too incompetent to be a long-term ally in this partnership.\"\n\nI think that's what I was responding to.\n\n\"Why did you even bother to message me regarding Turkey? Again, do you have something in mind to use against him\"\n\nWell, no. Because apparently Turkey is an idiot and doesn't realize that I have a stalemate line, assuming Germany doesn't stab me (Which he might.) But even if he does, Germany will get everything and Turkey nothing.\n\nBut if Germany doesn't stab me, rest assured that Turkey will stab you. There's just no one stupid enough to not do it.\r\n2 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Regarding the army build -- on one hand, yes, A Nap would have been an unambiguous way to signal a Lepanto. ...which is exactly why I didn't do it, because Turkey had a build and, while it was incredibly unlikely, had he built F Smy I would have telegraphed my intention and gotten blocked completely unnecessarily. And in any case he would have known what I was doing were I to build A Nap.\n\nAnd yes, the talking was a problem. I had messaged about it, but it got [1618679], I'm pretty sure. Else I was on mind-altering substances. Or dreamed that I did it. (The last one is actually more likely than you think. I've had it happen before...) In any case this probably would have gone much differently had I paid more attention, so that's on me.\n\nThe snipe at your intelligence was my icy response to the implication that I wouldn't have been good alliance material long-term.\n\nAs for Germany, I am reasonably confident he's coming to help, but Turkey hasn't said anything this phase and Germany and I didn't really talk much about his plans for you, so that could be misplaced confidence. This looks to me like it's shaping up to be a Tiger draw, though I'll admit I'm banking on a breakthrough in France that might not be forthcoming. If it doesn't happen quick... Turkey has actually proven himself to be the type of player I would trust to carry an IT alliance for a long time, but unless Turkey is a saint, that temptation to stab is going to be tough for him to ward off.\r\n3 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Honestly, I think RGT is more likely than TIG. But that's entirely dependent on Germany, to be honest.\r\n4 RUSSIA -> ITALY: That and Germany knows that if it comes between you all defeating me and his soloing, I'll choose his soloing every time.\r\n5 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Um... that's interesting... I don't mean that sarcastically, either. What incentive would either of them have to keep you around? They'd be doing all the work, wouldn't they?\r\n6 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Germany needs my fleet. And Turkey can't eliminate me, because of the stalemate.\n\nIf Germany's not lying to me, this &will& be an RGT. But he's likely lying to me, I have no disillusions about that, and have told him as such. But he claims he wants to keep me around.\r\n7 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Needs your fleet for what, the Englishmen sitting on their asses or the Frenchmen thoroughly distracted to the south? ;) I'm sure he likes you, you're a likable player, but I like to think I am, too, and I can actually help him KO the Frenchman (who, I should note, is being written off in the final draw by everyone right now...).\n\nYou're right about Turkey on his own being unable to eliminate you, but I suspect that he won't be alone. Germany is the one driving this game now.\r\n8 RUSSIA -> ITALY: You're right. And ultimately it's pretty irrelevant. But Germany doesn't have much reason to lie to me, ATM, if you ask me.\r\n9 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Yeah, that's true, too. You'd be doing what you're doing regardless.\r\n",

Just to placate concerns there. I would like to catch France off guard still but open to any suggestions/thoughts you have.\r\n1 TURKEY -> ITALY: From my perspective, we've worked well together since the beginning. I have no intention of stabbing you and I hope we can take this partnership all the way. I'm not going to attack you unless you decide to pick France and come after me, in which case I'll be very sad but just try to weather the storm.\n\nIf you want to attack France, I'm perfectly happy to help you do that. If you want me to pull my LYO fleet back somewhere, I could do that too.\r\n2 TURKEY -> ITALY: Let me know what you want to do!\r\n3 ITALY -> TURKEY: Initially, my concern stemmed from if you started taking over Russia & I'm more vulnerable to you anyhow, and it wouldn't be difficult to take my Scs after, resulting in a rather natural solo.\n\nBut I recognize your loyalty and would like to continue. I don't mind your fleets that much & you haven't turned them on me before.\n\nSeeing as France thinks I'm working with them, a support into Mars from Pie and one from Tyrr into Tunis would work, I believe, and be rather effective. If you're down for it.\r\n4 ITALY -> TURKEY: Russia is asking for help from me but I won't be extending it in this case. Would you mind if I don't extend support moves into Russian territory?\r\n5 ITALY -> TURKEY: You have quite a few units to be able to tackle rather effectively, I think!\r\n6 TURKEY -> ITALY: Sounds good to me. While a solo is always nice, I'm not one of those players who thinks anything short of that is a loss. To me making IT work successfully is a win.\n\nYou have my support into Mar and Tun.\r\n7 ITALY -> TURKEY: That's wonderful to hear :) let's do it. I've never had it fully pan out before either, so it's quite exciting, aha.\nHoping the busy-ness over the weekend is dying down so you can catch your breath.\r\n8 ITALY -> TURKEY: It's fine to move my land units away then, yes? Or did you want me to do anything with them?\r\n9 TURKEY -> ITALY: Just too many diplomacy games to juggle haha\n\nI'm happy for your land units to move away.

        "intent_dialogue": "0 ITALY -> TURKEY: Well firstly everything was fine between us until you built a fleet, when you said you would build an army, so that was a big lie. Then after that you said that we should 'pretend' fight with each other which you then said would look a lot like real warfare. Perspective or not that is the truth of what happened here, go check your archive out.\n\nI have tried since then to make sure that we would not engage each other but you were unwilling to commit anything to me, you never told me you would attack Russia etc., making me think you would come for me. You tell me not to move into certain areas while at the same time not really offering any kind of idea as to what you will be doing in the future/ if you were even in the least bit interested in being my ally.\n\nI then offer to make certain moves, which you then reject. Your diplomacy is failing you here, neither of us can make the other do something we want with the stick so it's time to move to the carrot approach if you are serious about being my friend, that would mean telling me where your units would be retreating to if you expect me to vacate AEG and ALB, not only that but that we discuss and put into action a plan against Russia, it is not enough that we simply stop our little game and go back to just sitting in stalemated positions.\r\n1 TURKEY -> ITALY: What have you offered that I have rejected?\r\n2 TURKEY -> ITALY: And, yes, the moves to ALB and EM a few turns back were quite aggressive and uncalled for. This escalated the situation a lot. You're threatening a lot of my centers, can't expect me to even consider attacking RUS when I can lose a couple of centers to you instantly.\n\nStop asking me why I don't want to work with you, but give me a specific plan if you don't like mine. You may want to keep in mind that due to our brilliant positioning I'll have to move BS to CON next turn, so my options for war with RUS are really decreasing with each turn you spend trying to attack me.\r\n3 ITALY -> TURKEY: By rejected I mean that every time I try to make us have a clear alliance you just don't do anything about it.\n\nOk here is the plan then. Since you will more than likely be moving BLA-CON and EM-SMY I suggest you move ION-EM and I will move AEG-ION. I would prefer if you let me disband one of your fleets but maybe we should build up a year of trust first. Then you can help me into BUD from TRI in the Spring, I will move ALB-TRI and then you get RUM.\r\n4 TURKEY -> ITALY: Can't you move AEG-ION with support?\r\n5 TURKEY -> ITALY: Ortherwise I agree with the plan, but for protection I may move EM-AEG and Ion-alb.\r\n6 ITALY -> TURKEY: Ok here is what we do. I bring AEG-ION with full support. You move ION-ALB. I will have pulled ALB-TRI with TRI being helped by VIE and SER into BUD. Then next year I move ION-TYR and you bring ALB back to ION and we can disband it. Additionally in the mean time I will have supported you into RUM, this will give you two additional armies and keeps us with the same amount of fleet to keep each other in check, any additional fleet I build will be heading West. Is that fine?\r\n7 TURKEY -> ITALY: You want me to support Tri-bud... I'm not sure I can do that.\n\nI'm sorry man, I'm really not willing to attack Russia in this position. Next turn maybe, if this one goes well. I agree about the fleet movement.\r\n8 ITALY -> TURKEY: er don't move to ALB so because I will only end up bouncing in BUD. If you support into ALB then that is war between us, best just to move ION-EM\r\n9 TURKEY -> ITALY: Hmm, ok, you do have a point.\n\nI will suggest you use Tri to hit Bud anyway.\r\n10 ITALY -> TURKEY: I am going to, but it is far from 100% certain without your support, so support me if you want but if you do not support me then please do not move to ALB with support.\r\n11 TURKEY -> ITALY: Yes, I got that :)\r\n12 ITALY -> TURKEY: well that was more a friendly reminder that support to BUD would be very much appreciated :P\r\n13 TURKEY -> ITALY: I know, I am considering it.\r\n",

It was a poor decision.\r\n1 ENGLAND -> AUSTRIA: I do not feel there is anything to reconcile, I do not hold a grudge for what you tried to do. The plan was sound and it made a lot of sense. It would have been a great blow to France but leaking of information was enough to put me off for the time being.\n\nThat being said I still feel we will have to cooperate in this game one way or another. Either against France or against Russia.\r\n2 AUSTRIA -> ENGLAND: I won't leak anymore information. I think the flow of the game will have us alive at the end of this and France, Russia, and Germany is just a matter of time.\n\nJust an idea, but I can still slip into Piedmont (france will move to tuscany), and allow him in Munich to draw his unit away (but I will move to BOH to steal it in the fall). France will either put Paris in GAS or BURG, but if you move to EC, then it's a 60/40 gamble that you will get Brest by fall without a hitch.\n\nI'm also moving on Russia with Germany, and you could take Kiel and St.p this year, and he will also lose Warsaw and Sev (possibly).\n\nJust an idea. There are plenty of options to consider. Let me know if you see any good angles.\r\n3 ENGLAND -> AUSTRIA: I agree there are alot of options and I will make my decision which way I will go very soon. Either way I agree with you that either one of these options will allow us to coordinate our moves very soon.\n\nSince you are supporting France into Tus are you also moving to Pie or is that conditional on me moving to Channel?\r\n4 AUSTRIA -> ENGLAND: it doesn't make sense for me to move to piedmont if you don't move to the channel. If he moves Paris to Gascony, he'd have to choose which center to give away, and he'd probably give you brest rather than give me marseilles. If he moves paris to burgundy, then you will have brest without a contest.\r\n5 ENGLAND -> AUSTRIA: Alright if we agree to make our moves I would expect compete silence from yourself and of course from me to the French.\r\n6 AUSTRIA -> ENGLAND: Yes, of course. Would you be willing to move against the Russian and leave the German for a buffer for now?\r\n7 ENGLAND -> AUSTRIA: If we agree to move against France I would not move against Russia, do not have enough forces for both campaigns\r\n8 AUSTRIA -> ENGLAND: Me and the Germany can take out Warsaw and Moscow. I have the Turk on board to take SEV. If you take Kiel and St.p then he's out. You can spare SKA, DEN&HEL, to finish him off. It is quick and easy and he's dead and can focus on other areas.\r\n9 ENGLAND -> AUSTRIA: I can spare it but that would postpone a move against France. I would rather move on France right now. You have enough firepower to take Russia down.\r\n10 AUSTRIA -> ENGLAND: I don't get why you would have to postpone? You slip in Brest with Nths. What will moving on Russia with those 3 units to knock him out, really delay for you?\r\n11 ENGLAND -> AUSTRIA: If I am to move against France I would move NTH SEA-ENG, CLY-NAO and SKA-NTH\r\n12 AUSTRIA -> ENGLAND: It's your choice. I think you will benefit most by getting 3 builds and leaving NTH open. You are giving up 2 builds and eliminating a player, just so you can feel cozy with a fleet in NTH... which you don't need since there are no enemy fleets around you, and you'd get 3 builds to move in mass in spring.\r\n13 AUSTRIA -> ENGLAND: Let's wait on France then. I'm not prepared to move on him since I have to deal with Russia.\r\n14 ENGLAND -> AUSTRIA: Fair enough. Are you still helping him get Rome this year?\r\n15 AUSTRIA -> ENGLAND: Yeah\r\n16 ENGLAND -> AUSTRIA: I guess with my builds I should be able to keep a good eye on him.\r\n17 AUSTRIA -> ENGLAND: He'll probably get 3 builds. I'd rather you get the three though... but I can't do that without your help with Russia also.\r\n18 ENGLAND -> AUSTRIA: How do you see him getting three builds? Rome, Munich and?\r\n19 AUSTRIA -> ENGLAND: tunis\r\n20 AUSTRIA -> ENGLAND: I think Italy will cut a deal with France and shift to work with Turkey. My guess though.\r\n21 ENGLAND -> AUSTRIA: That will depend on how Italy plays. That is no guarantee.\r\n22 AUSTRIA -> ENGLAND: But I'm sure France is promising Italy survival or something if he gives up Tunis and opts for Greece... or offering him Venice back or to keep Naples and will stop at Tunis.\r\n23 ENGLAND -> AUSTRIA: Of course.\r\n24 AUSTRIA -> ENGLAND: Italy is not happy with me at all - so this wouldn't surprise me.\r\n25 AUSTRIA -> ENGLAND: You sure you don't want to take both Russia and France with me?\r\n26 ENGLAND -> AUSTRIA: I do want to take both Russia and France but not at the same time. One at the time.\r\n27 AUSTRIA -> ENGLAND: Ok. Let me know.\r\n",

I believe the western triple could have worked to the end.\r\n1 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I just sent England the following message:\n\n\"England, what are you doing?!?\n\nYou are guaranteeing that we will be picked apart by Russia/Italy/Turkey. We were in such great position, and the only way we could screw it up is by one of us stabbing the other.\n\nThankfully, it's nothing that can't be fixed. Please, please, please, tell me you will reverse your moves this fall. If you don't, you will have a lot of French fleets headed your way.\"\r\n2 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I know that this is asking a lot, but is there any way you could hold your line against Russia/Italy for one more turn? Give me one turn to try to talk England out of this madness.\n\nIf England will reverse his moves, our position against Russia/Italy/Turkey will not be compromised. But if you react by moving forces toward England, then we will never recover this positioning.\r\n3 GERMANY -> FRANCE: He is not responding me. I can't wIT to next turn. You have 15 hours to convince him, then I will remove my line in the east, and [1702103]/Turkey will quickly regain their strenght.\r\n4 FRANCE -> GERMANY: England has not responded to me either.\n\nThis is my plan. If England responds and promises to reverse his moves, I will let you know. If that happens, I will hold my current line for one season to see if England makes good on his promise. I will ask you to do the same. I understand you will feel pressure to do otherwise, but I will ask all the same. I still think a united England/Germany/France is the best chance we have of getting a draw, so we have to give it a shot if England indicates he is willing to reconsider his current course.\n\nIf I do not hear from England, I will start moving fleets his way immediately. You and I may lose, but we can certainly take England down with us.\r\n5 FRANCE -> GERMANY: Still nothing from England. Have you heard anything?\r\n6 FRANCE -> GERMANY: In about 8-9 hours, it will be night here and I'll go to sleep. If England does not respond by then, that is when I will change my orders to start moving on England. I'll be sure to let you know one way or another by then.\r\n7 GERMANY -> FRANCE: OK\r\n8 GERMANY -> FRANCE: England has muted me, so I can't even text him. I have not experienced that [1320324] before. Is he drunk? Are you involved in this master plan? I guess he discussed the moves with you in advance, didn't he?\nMaybe I should just give all my support centers to the competition.\r\n9 FRANCE -> GERMANY: No, he did not discuss the stab with me, and if he did I would have strongly discouraged it.\n\nI have nothing to gain from you being weakened, and in fact I think it is likely that I will lose as a result of England's foolish move.\n\nI am trying my best to get England to see reason, but if he doesn't respond to me there is only so much I can do.\n\nIf he has muted you, then I suspect I will be left with little choice but to turn my fleets around and attack him.\n\nIt sucks because I was just about to take Piedmont.\r\n10 FRANCE -> GERMANY: England has just muted me as well. I will be attacking him.\n\nLet's make sure he takes no points from this game.\r\n",

Will also move SIL-MUN...then I should get NOR ~N~ Then we have two choices....either stab each other or head for the MED. I have no intention of stabbing you (although I might try and persuade Russia that I will to try and get him to stab Turkey) - you might well be best derved by stabbing me but I dont think it will do any good other than to help Russia and consequently Turkey ~N~ ~N~ So I think the only way forward if yu want to win is in the Med....what do you think? ~N~ Will you move from PIE-TYR? Maybe Italy will help you?\r\n1 FRANCE -> GERMANY: Why would you have to retreat Mun to Ruhr? Defend Sil as good as you can, and if you somehow happen to lose both Sil and Pru, it is autumn - you can build at Kiel next turn... but I think it won't happen. I think you won't have trouble stopping Russia at Berlin-munich line since he has no naval support. As I said, at worst case I will have to move to Bur to give you extra support hold at Munich. I don't think he will be getting in Tyrolia. By then, you will have a fleet in BS to defend anyways. ~N~ ~N~ Regarding future alliance, I think you will need help from one, or even two units of mine to take Stp if he keeps using Liv and Moscow to support hold (This is another reason why he can't advance further - he needs his units to defend Stp, and he is losing units) ~N~ ~N~ My bet is Turkey will stab Russia this turn or soon.. It was extremely stupid of him to see Italy as a weak defender and try to finish him off before stabbing Russia - Now the units he should use to march to Moscow are bogged down defending Trieste. I think it is a bad idea to encourage him to stab Russia - Right now we are slowly winning in both fronts, if Turkey takes the hold, it will be a tougher fight. ~N~ ~N~ I will decide Pie Tyr or Pie Tus with Italy - most likely Tyr. If you move to Ruhr, I will have to move to Bur and/or Bel.\r\n2 GERMANY -> FRANCE: well my reasons would be a) to defend because I cant break through his ranks and b) to try and draw him forward to maybe create weaknesses...I will not try and will STP but I can keep his forces tied up defending it ~N~ If I move to Ruhr and you move to BUR we have a rock solid defence on the Northern side of the SM line....somehow we need to entice Turkey to stab Russia!\r\n3 FRANCE -> GERMANY: No, as I said in my analysis, Turkey should not stab Russia ~N~ ~N~ And can you rephrase part b regarding STP?\r\n4 GERMANY -> FRANCE: sorry...I meant the other way round...Russia to stab Turkey! ~N~ ~N~ and b) is supposed to say (!) that I will not try and take STP but rather just keep his units committed to defending it. Then if he advances against SIL/PRU he will be overstretched\r\n5 FRANCE -> GERMANY: Well, why not take it\r\n6 GERMANY -> FRANCE: cos it doesnt do me any good and it leaves me exposed to a stab from you!\r\n7 GERMANY -> FRANCE: whats your plan? We should co-ordinate...just to reiterate, I am happy to be your Kingmaker in this game....I dont share Dms view!\r\n8 FRANCE -> GERMANY: It does not do you any good? ~N~ ~N~ It gives you one more unit to defend and closes a front, allowing you to use your fleets to defend against me. It costs Russia one more unit, which means one less army to maintain his siege against you. ~N~ ~N~ My plan was to help you take Stp then retreat to a line where we can keep NS as a DMZ with fleets clashing each other there to prevent stabs. Since you don't want Stp, I think we should do that as soon as you take Norway.\r\n9 GERMANY -> FRANCE: ok - agreed ~N~ If I take stp he will disband fleet not army - he is totally paranoid about turkish stab...I think its better if we leave it there using up his resources to defend ~N~ what about plan in the Med?\r\n10 FRANCE -> GERMANY: Well, Italy isn't the talkative type, but I think we can hold our line.. I'm moving to Tyr unless Italy says otherwise.\r\n",

I suggest Ns-norway, Den supports Baltic Sea-swe (If you do the other way around, you have slightly more momentum but you will have to build at Kiel since he might retreat to Ska) ~N~ ~N~ Oh and with the armies.. I suggest you either cooperate more with Italy, or move Sil to Pru to try and get in Liv. He will most likely take either Boh or Sil... which is the reason that I'm suggesting that I move into Ruhr or at least Bur to help you support hold just in case.. he has got a lot of land power\r\n3 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Italy is not proving very co-operative. Not sure he is very good at this...anyway, Turkey is about to walk all over him ~N~ Im somewhat concerned about being outflanked down in TYR ~N~ Agree in SWE ~N~ What are your thoughts about the South...it will not take Turkey too many turns to reach you!\r\n4 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I hope to get 2 builds from England. They will be directed towards south... seems like you are doig well against Russia anyways.. ~N~ ~N~ Regarding the outflank.. build one more army and think you should be fine.. if you need it my armies can come down south to support hold.. ~N~ ~N~ Turkey thinks he can finish Italy and turn on Russia, or something. I somehow doubt that.\r\n5 FRANCE -> GERMANY: Now that I have EC, do you mind if Pic passes through Bur to move on towards Italy?\r\n6 GERMANY -> FRANCE: id prefer it if it was BEL\r\n7 FRANCE -> GERMANY: ok\r\n8 GERMANY -> FRANCE: cool..if you move BEL - BUR - MAR then Ill change my flag to a [1104840] in your honour (dont water it down by moving PIC - BEL though :) )....if you fuck me (which you may well do) then I will dedicate the rest of the game to your destruction :) ~N~ Turkey/Russia is now the enemy... ~N~ Italy doesnt seem to be in the game at all...any thoughts? did you speak to him?\r\n9 FRANCE -> GERMANY: not much..\r\n10 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I have another idea in my mind, might convoy pic to gas or spain\r\n11 GERMANY -> FRANCE: thats a good idea...Turkey is coming. Will be in the west med in 3/4 turns tops\r\n12 FRANCE -> GERMANY: Bad thing with Den.. because he is in Sil at the same time.. but I Think you have got one advantage. ~N~ ~N~ Build at Berlin, support Boh into Munich.. I think my army will have to stick around to support your hold if you don't mind. ~N~ ~N~ think you might have to either let Ska loose or lose Sweden defending - hope he disbands that one. ~N~ ~N~ Pru is a huge advantage though.. Move to Liv and he is screwed with you bordering 3 home Scs.\r\n13 GERMANY -> FRANCE: i decided to be more aggressive in SWE ~N~ Would be better if you move BUR-MAR and PIC-BUR this turn so that you can defend/attack in the south and help defend MUN if necessary ~N~ I think he will disband SEV but that might leave him open to stab from Turkey....I have had zero luck negotiating with Turkey, he has ALL his eggs in Russia's basket ~N~ In my view we NEED to get into Italy to save the game\r\n14 FRANCE -> GERMANY: Depending on England's disbandment, I might send one or two fleets towards Italy's way.. along with that army. Yeah, Pic-bur is good.\r\n",

I shall be able to say an awful lot more soon.\r\n2 ENGLAND -> RUSSIA: ok good - we need to form a strong alliance in this game or we will be doomed ~N~ LIV can cover WAR if Austria moves to GAL and you will take BER in Autumn and can build in WAR ... by then Germany will be tamed and you can shore up the South...have you spoken to Turkey about Austria?\r\n3 ENGLAND -> RUSSIA: could i ask you to move Baltic - Kiel? then I can afford to move NS rather than use it to support into DEN?\r\n4 RUSSIA -> ENGLAND: You still don't need to use it for support: Ska support, Sweden move. ~N~ ~N~ Would it be possible for you to tell me what you intend to do with Sweden, Ska, and Norwegian and North Seas, because they are sensitive and I can use Baltic Sea accordingly.\r\n5 ENGLAND -> RUSSIA: yes but he will defend DEN with Kiel ~N~ If you could take out his support this turn then I will move my fleets away from STP\r\n6 RUSSIA -> ENGLAND: Two Supports defeat one support. I am uneasy that you wish to have me play differently for the sake of difference.\r\n7 ENGLAND -> RUSSIA: yes but if i have one support and you support then I can move my fleets out of the way at the same time...otherwise you'll have to wait a turn\r\n8 RUSSIA -> ENGLAND: What exactly do you want to do?\r\n9 ENGLAND -> RUSSIA: move my fleets round 1 space - ie to NS/HEL ready to execute our plan...if you cant break Kiel support ehn Ill have to use NS AND Ska to support ~N~ No worries - ill do this - we're in no hurry :) ~N~ Are you having second thoughts?\r\n10 ENGLAND -> RUSSIA: I hope you do ally with me this turn - otherwise Ill be forced to ally with the bloody frenchman! ~N~ If we can tie it up this turn we'll be game-long allies...this will be a draw and the two of us will be in good shape - especially if we can get as far as the stalemate line between us :) ~N~ ~N~ You might have to give up Sev at some stage bu you'll get most of Germany and hopefully Ill get France - then it will be a matter of whether we get to that position whiclst they are still squabbling in the Balkans and we can clean up or whether they will get their act together when they see us coming...\r\n11 ENGLAND -> RUSSIA: by the way - I think virtually all the league games will be draws ~N~\r\n12 RUSSIA -> ENGLAND: OK, I shall play Baltic S move to Denmark from Sweden or Skarr? ~N~ ~N~ In League A trials there were two solos in the games that were played...\r\n13 RUSSIA -> ENGLAND: Ok, I shall be as clear as possible here, since a lack of clarity lost us some ability to make progress there. I am ready to attack Berlin from the Baltic sea, with Support from Silesia. If you play Denmark to Kiel, it will guarentee that I actually capture it. To protect Denmark however, since there will be a German fleet in Heligoland Bight, you will also have to attack Denmark with both Sweden and North Sea. ~N~ ~N~ Once Germany is forced to disband two units, his defeat will be both swift and easy.\r\n14 RUSSIA -> ENGLAND: Also note I shall be playing into St.petersburg to defend that province.\r\n15 ENGLAND -> RUSSIA: Im not sure what the lack of clarity was...I asked that you take out his support from Kiel with Baltci Sea...as it turns out you didnt do anything at all to help ~N~ Please dont move to STP...that would be aggressive. I like the move to MOS ... good defence ~N~ I will move out of NOR away from STP so that there is nothing bordering you but if you move back there Ill be nervous and be forced to come back again ~N~ You should get into BER this turn and get a build in WAR\r\n16 RUSSIA -> ENGLAND: Well, sadly your nervousness and mine are exactly equivalent except for one thing: I am nervous in the Fall, you will be nervous in the Spring. I propose the following: ~N~ ~N~ I move to St.p this coming turn. You leave Norway. ~N~ I leave St.p next Spring and we declare Norweigen Sea, Barents sea, Norway Finland and St.p a DMZ. ~N~ ~N~ If I were to enter Norway next spring, you could easily push me out again, so there would be absolutely no point. What say you? ~N~ ~N~ As for the lack of clarity, it was that you never said what you wanted to go to Denmark, I wasn't entirely sure what you were doing that meant support move wouldn't work, which worried me, as I can see now, unnecessarily so. My trust in you is very nearly there. I hope that by the end of next year we will both have shown ourselves to be trustworthy so the alliance can continue to flourish when the pickings are less rich than they are now.\r\n17 ENGLAND -> RUSSIA: We are building up some trust here - dont chuck it away. This is not a big ploy to try and trick my way in to STP. Im pretty sure I could take it by force if I wanted...but I dont. I want to be allies and I think we will be a strong partnership ~N~ ~N~ Going your way will just waste precious time, so plse trust me here ~N~ ~N~ I was very clear that I asked you to take out support from Kiel so dont be giving that shit! It was clear so dont treat me like an idiot...lets forget it and move on ~N~ ~N~ If you had agreed to do so I could have moved my fleets away from NOR/STP and positioned them to stop France coming to support Germany (who are now allied I think) so lets not waste any more time\r\n18 ENGLAND -> RUSSIA: SO please DO NOT move back to STP (in case it wasnt clear!)\r\n19 RUSSIA -> ENGLAND: Sorry, I really don't see what was wrong with my suggestion. In two turns time you still will have two units outside Norway, surely? ~N~ ~N~ Regardless, If I don't play there, I still could build there, so in terms of security for yourself, it worsens matters surely, because F St.petersburg (nc) is obviously worse. ~N~ ~N~ I would like to make it absolutely clear that I want to make sure that this is resolved as well as is possible. I would also like to say that I realise that I was far too over-cautious last turn, and I apologise for that.\r\n20 ENGLAND -> RUSSIA: If it wasn't already clear then please do not move to STP and please do not build there either. I do not like to dictate terms ever but either of these actions by you will undo all the hard work of creating a trusting alliance and will likely lead to us becoming immediate enemies (as strategically I will need to eradicate the threat in STP and shore it up) ~N~ It is possible that we will stab each other much later in the game but for the next ten years or so we would serve each others' interests strongly by working together ~N~ I have helped engineer a good situation for you here out of a potentially very bad one so a slightly more open approach to our negotiations would go a long way :) ~N~ I have not done anything to threaten your interests in any way at any stage! ~N~ Now - lets go kill Germany and get two builds each so we can face the rest of the World fully armed!\r\n",

So I am asking you to do the smart thing, Abandon Austria and Focus on France before he dooms us all.\r\n1 GERMANY -> ITALY: I can propose an action that keeps you protected from me and offers prosperity. Serbia to Triest with Venice support, i can help if you want. Tyrrhenian Sea to Gulf of Lyons, Ionian Sea hold, Tunis to Western Med. Build fleet Naples. Austria will lose at least two, maybe three centers, so he is basically out, You gain a build, a jump on a sleeping France and security from the East due to an ensuing war. I get territory (hopefully) and at least negate my loss of Belgium. Turkey gets Sevastopol. It's a win-win-win, just take the deal. So, what do you say?\r\n2 ITALY -> GERMANY: as far as i can see you have already enough help from Turkey ... no if i bring down austria i will fall with him after a few moves , if it isn't by you , than it will be by turkey\n\ni think you will win this game, the bad ( or not playing) of england gave you that advantage ... i tried to get the others all on 1 line against you , but i don't think it work , so i will do as much as i can to survive , i ll consider to take out austria , but i won't pull my frontline against france and let all the backdoor open for turkey\r\n3 GERMANY -> ITALY: Can you at least move just tyrr or just tunis? What can we do about trieste? I am fine with giving it to you and if turkey is honest, Serbia should be safe.\r\n4 GERMANY -> ITALY: At least this year, I mean.\r\n5 ITALY -> GERMANY: hmm maybe i better come from venice and let serbia stand\r\n6 GERMANY -> ITALY: Okay, I presume you will want tyrolia to go back to munich.\r\n7 GERMANY -> ITALY: Or do you want it to support your move?\r\n8 ITALY -> GERMANY: yes i would want you to move tyrolia back to munich , maybe you will need it against france.\nyou may support me , but i think you ll use Vienna and Galicia to take budapest , not ?\r\n9 GERMANY -> ITALY: Okay, i will choose to defend Munich rather than support.\r\n10 GERMANY -> ITALY: So what about moving just Tyrr or Tunis to spook France a little?\r\n11 ITALY -> GERMANY: i ll consider that\r\n12 GERMANY -> ITALY: Fair enough.

I'm a bit disappointed about his army build but it's not the end of the world and we can certainly move on from this.\r\n3 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: I can't chat much right now, but I will be on later tonight to discuss tactics further.\r\n4 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: yeah no problem. i'm asking him to move to tus which I think is a legit request. I don't think it will be an issue.\r\n5 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: Yeah, he's reassured me that he will honor the dmz in Ven, so I would expect him to do that as well.\r\n6 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: ok sounds good. i'm still trying to figure out how to outguess england haha.\r\n7 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: I'm trying imagine how I would defend if I were in England's shoes. That led me to start thinking about how France could defend as that seems to make the potential English moves more clear.\n\nFrance could order Bre-pic, Gas-bur to keep Paris safe. Paris would support one of those moves, depending on what England orders. That leaves Spa to make a guess on either Gol or WMS in an attempt to stall the Italian fleet advance.\n\nBel being open creates a bit of a nuisance. The fleet in Eng could try for that hoping that you might leave that open, but he might just rely on the threat of that to compel you to cover. F Eng also has the option to support Bre-pic, which would then mean that Par would support Gas-bur. However, maybe losing Bel isn't such a big threat since Kie-hol may likely set up to retake in the fall.\n\nEngland could try to make a play on Nth, but that seems to be much less productive and easily countered, as you could either cut or take Nwy with Swe. Another potential move for Nwy might be Ska, as he could be hoping to bounce a Den move, or even if it succeeds threaten Swe and Den, forcing a check back to cover.\n\nI'm not so sure what Edi could do. It seems that keeping it must have been primarily a defensive move to prevent a potential fall move on Lvp without having to pull back Eng.\n\nAlright, those are some of my thoughts on the west. I'm sure you've already considered most of those possibilities, but hopefully it helps to get a second perspective. It's going to take some guess work, so no need to divulge the details.\r\n8 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: By the way, I'm still planning on moving Galicia to Warsaw, so I would appreciate the support from Sil. Thanks.\n\nWhat do you think about the possibility of Russia retreating or moving to Pru? I think it's unlikely as he would suffer heavy home losses and anyways you would have Ber covered with Sil, but it's something to be mindful about.\r\n9 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: well, his only retreat would be pru, so yes, I'd have to pull sil back. bt I'm ok with doing that if needed in the fall. i actually kind of expect it. but i'm guessing you'll be able to hold war on your own without needing me at that point.\n\nthank you for your perspective on the western side. indeed it will be a guessing game and I can only hope to outguess or [656927] him again ;) we shall see.\r\n10 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: FYI - my expectation is that England will move Norway to Stp. please do not bounce him there from Mos if that was part of your plan as it will let me get into Norway. if we desire, i can support Mos into Stp in the fall.\r\n",

However, I think the fact that you can actually help Germany will sway him to switch sides.\r\n1 ENGLAND -> AUSTRIA: Yes, I am willing to make a move on Russia, as Russia will certainly hit me. I will touch base with Germany, though I am out of town until Sunday night, so my access is a little limited at the moment. I'll let you know what Germany says, feel free to put in a good word for me!\r\n2 AUSTRIA -> ENGLAND: I will!\nAre you talking to France? I might have something interesting to tell you, but I need your word that you'll never let anybody know it came from me.\r\n3 ENGLAND -> AUSTRIA: Yeah, I'm talking to France. I'm all for hearing interesting things and I'll take it to the grave, won't go past me!\r\n4 AUSTRIA -> ENGLAND: What does France tell you? France says he's all for siding with you and Germany.

You can't hold mao anyways, and if Italy takes both bre and spa, he'll build even though I stab him, and then we'll both be doomed.\n\nSo pic-bar, eng-bre might be a good move =)\nAnd I never said that.\r\n5 AUSTRIA -> ENGLAND: pic-par, that is.\r\n6 ENGLAND -> AUSTRIA: Where are you suggesting Pic go?!\n\nHave you told me the interesting thing already?\n\nFrance and I are communicating, but just talking about moves to make.\n\nMust run!\r\n7 AUSTRIA -> ENGLAND: pic-par! Although if you could get pic-bar, it would put quite a bit of pressure on stp. And break the site to boot. Run fast!\r\n8 AUSTRIA -> ENGLAND: Well, the French say they're not supporting Italy to bre, and I'm more inclined to believe France than to believe Italy. Somebody's attacking bre though . . . might want to defend it.\r\n9 ENGLAND -> AUSTRIA: Oh, Italy told you Par was supporting Gas to Brest?

Yeah, way to confuse me, damnit!! ;)\r\n13 AUSTRIA -> ENGLAND: Sorry!

If Germany Nmrs I can just support an attack on Den and hope Fin doesn't attack Norway, though if Germany comes around I hope to get support into Den while North Sea defends Norway.

Do you think the others would agree to cancel if the Germans drop out?\r\n21 AUSTRIA -> ENGLAND: Whether or not the Germans NMR, I'm going to need you to hit Russia hard next year. I would love to see swe and den fall, followed by stp in 1906. By then, either me or Turkey should be in sev, and we shouldn't have to worry too much about Russia any more.\r\n22 ENGLAND -> AUSTRIA: Doubtful. I'm guessing Germany will be back though.\n\nJust how quickly I advance against Russia will likely be at least somewhat determined by the German, so it's a wait and see game.\n\nPlease confirm you will be hitting Naples! :)\r\n23 AUSTRIA -> ENGLAND: Naples will be red after this turn.\nWouldn't it be nice if Russia Nmrd?\r\n24 AUSTRIA -> ENGLAND: Still no Germany?\r\n",

I am telling him that you are moving BLA-RUM (with my support) and CON-AEG. He is allowing me to get you into RUM so we can push you out in the FALL and he plans on moving BUL-CON as he thinks you will be leaving it empty for the Spring, with your army moving into a bounce-able position for the Autumn. I am also telling him that I hope to make it into BLA with SEV after your fleet moves to RUM so that he can only have GAL hold BUL in order for the move to succeed.\nHopefully he will fall for this which will allow you to repeat your moves from last phase and get ARM into BUL as he will be moving. Also as he will hopefully only have GAL holding RUM, I will be able to support UKR-RUM, so that we can take 2 Scs off him in the Spring, this should hopefully allow us to convince Italy to switch sides for the fall (even if we will not fully trust him/give him our troop movements).\nI know the whole plan is a bit ambitious, but at the very least you will get a build and this will go a long way in fighting Austria. Plus we need to start taking risks before Italy comes to help.

Listen I know Austria is a liar but I am convinced that he will make a move on CON this turn because he thinks I am desperate to help him out to save myself, also the fact that you are not talking to him means that I am his only option to cooperate with. If we don't try something drastic then he will eventually over take us anyway or we will just sit all us us while the other countries grow and then we will be dead too.\nJust give my plan a shot this Spring and if it does not work then we will do what you want. Is your problem putting your trust in me?AS you can see Austria will always try to play us against each other so I know I cannot work with him, that's why we need to cause some serious damage this [1466523] on and take a chance.\r\n6 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I have no problem putting my trust in you.

You have done everything possible this game to avoid fighting FRA and make sure you both fight me. How about change the tune before getting eliminated.\n\nI'll deal with FRA later - for sure not while I have a kamikadze headed my way - this is some very strange logic you apply there :)\n\nIn summary, you've doing a great job of making it impossible for me to attack FRA - not really sure what you expect - I'm not suicidal as you might have noticed :)\r\n2 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: France will be getting all of my centers. i am glad that you built the army. that is a great first step. i will not be attakcking you this turn. i will be making sure i keep north sea, though.\n\ni cannot survive if you do not attack france. i recognize this. which is why i am telling you that if you continue to attack me i will be throwing centers to france. end of story. doees that make sense?:)\r\n3 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Look.\n1. You have to realize that you cannot blackmail me. I will deal with FRA later if needed, but if you're not fighting him you're in no position to even ask me to attack him. Why do you think I should care about you if you don't yourself.\n2. You had a number of chances to move against RUS and take St.p. You didn't. You had a number of chances to move to stop FRA, you again didn't. What conclusion was I expected to derive from this? :)\n\nIn the current situation it's very hard to turn things around - as chances are you'll be losing two centers. Tell me what your plan is and I'll try to work something out to get involved against FRA this Autumn.\r\n4 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: This is how I see the game:\nthe juggernaut is coming. if it is you, france, and the juggernaut, do you think france is going to work with you or help the juggernaut swallow you? the answer is pretty obvious.\n\nand i only lose one center unless you attack north sea.\r\n5 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: How about when he moves to LIV or YOR with the army now? :)\n\nIt is very early to worry about a Juggernaut. IT is alive and kicking. Plus, if there's a Juggernaut, I am sure FRA will work with me - he is experienced enough to know that if he doesn't then he'll be next victim.\n\nLook, what is the point of this conversation exactly? You said you'll fight me until I attack FRA, I responded I will not attack FRA until you are attacking me. You keep threatening me with doom and gloom :)\n\nThis is not leading us anywhere. If you want me to side with you I need to hear a plan - and in the current situation your only plan is that throw myself against FRA with everything I've got, which I won't do before you've committed yourself at full.\n\nYou need to take some risks now and defend your home-land - and it is getting a bit late - so, please, start thinking about this seriously. I cannot hit FRA as he is in a position to immediately offer you an alliance, which you'll take as it's too good an offer. I need you and FRA in a position where you cannot ally against me - and I actually have you there in the moment, totally in Fra's favor, yes, but this is still better than having you both attacking me.\n\nI think the only option would be for me to take the NS. Otherwise you can simply support FRA into BEL next turn. Sorry for the tough demands, but you're in a desperate situation and I have to acknowledge this risk.\r\n6 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: i know you are a good enough player to know that france is a good enough player to know that the juggernaut is no threat to him. we both are in tough positions right now, which is why we should wrk together. unfortunately, the reason why you are in a tough position is because you aren't going to make any gains against me, which will be terrible for you one i am gone.\n\ni need that to continue or else you will have no incentive to ally with me. i cannot give you north. you only asked for that in an attempt to let you get a piece of the action.\n\nso lets discuss moves: encourage france to convoy another army to my mainland. this will allow you to force burgundy in the spring. italy has given me every indication that he would be willing to move to piedmont to help you from there. may as well at least ask him.\n\noh, and just wondering, italy says your fear of the juggernaut is keeping you from working with me, which makes no sense, which makes me think he is lying.... is he?\r\n7 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Man, I am sorry, but I guess I can't help you. You did nothing against FRA or RUS when you had the chance, which could have made both our lives easier and now we're in situation where it's too hard and too risky.\n\nI don't want a war with FRA in the moment and won't move to BUR, sorry.\n\nGuess we somehow did not start on the best terms and you clearly went against me, which noone else did, so I organized the whole game around it. It simply makes no sense for me to even try hitting FRA, as I actually expect him to cover BUR with support, same like last year.\n\nI'll stay in touch, maybe things will change.\r\n8 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I did not move against you one time until last turn. Before then, you had taken Belgium from me and rotated to skaggerack (instead of Baltic sea). You gave me no options.\r\n9 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: All I am saying now is taht you will not be gaining any centers from me. that seems pretty clear. so we may as well work together.... where else are you going to grow except for france? and do you really think russia and france won't crush you between them?\r\n10 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Then why the hell didn't you take St.p. or move against FRA or something. I can take SWE from SKA and DEN, but you keep hitting them so I don't even want to try - as it will fail and all I will get is an enemy.\n\nSorry, I understand what you're saying, but your 'solution' is actually reducing any chances of me siding with you, and it's been like this all game. Maybe it's also my fault to a large extent - but both RUS and FRA were more helpful, more friendly, and less threatening.\n\nSorry, I don't want to lie about this, I am not going to attack FRA in this situation.\r\n11 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Then what are your long-term goals? if i get a sense fo this i can get a sense of what i can do to help you achieve them.\r\n12 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: A war with FRA will be long, so I need to eliminate the risk of a second front war with RUS before that. This means taking out his North and gaining all of Scandinavia.\n\nThis is why I have been pushing you to attack him - so that at least one of the 4 is out. Being GER and in the center of it all I need people to drop out.\n\nI don't want FRA to take all of ENG, so I'm willing to help there, but I need a stronger position in the North before that. Currently both you and RUS can attack me which makes FRA the least of my worries.\r\n13 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I don't quite understand what moves I can make to help you, though. I could probably support you to sweden from norway, but i am willing to bet the support would be cut by st. petersburg. and i cant make moves that let you take north sea, because then i lost all bargaining power (as i am sure you understand).... so what are you thinking?\r\n",

Sorry for that.\n\nLooks like Russia disbanded in Nor after all! That's good news. Shall we pursue our discussions regarding the NTH and our strategy over the coming year?\r\n1 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I've saved some moves but I'm still waiting for us to work through the details of this phase to put the real ones in.\n\nI think it likely that we can secure Paris and Brest this year while I convoy to Norway and set that fleet in Barents in the Fall.\nI still would like to bring Lon in NTH and see NTH move to Bel as you wanted. I would then, in the fall, make the moves towards St-p I've discussed in the opening paragraph. In the west, I could likely take Brest with your help in the spring while you move into Bur and set up for Paris. With a hit on MAO from NAO, France would have to disband the Brest fleet (unless he moves Gas to cover Spain, which translates into an open Paris).\nBy bringing Italy in the mix where Iberia is concerned, your greatly limiting my chances to grow. I would much rather not see Italy get Mar too quickly, otherwise he could eventually stalemate my progress in the southern waters and our alliance very much requires that I'm able to move there (since I south of St-p should mostly be yours anyway).\n\nThose are my thoughts for now. What are yours?\r\n2 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: yes, lots to talk about. don't have time right now, but will write more soon. thanks for the details overall, I do hope we can make gains quickly.\r\n3 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Looking forward to when time will be on our side!\n\nRussia and France are working hard at getting Austria to turn on you. My last words to Austria were that France and Russia should not be given the chance to catch their breath, but that I was aware of the dangers of an unbalanced centre distribution.\nI know you have a good relation with Austria, but you might want to make sure it remains that way by making sure to spend some diplomatic time talking to him. As for us, I'm hoping to hear from you before the end phase.\r\n4 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: My moves right now are:\nNor to Barents\nLon to NTH (assuming you're moving to Bel, which is not something I'm taking for granted, so please don't read me as imposing my choices)\nLiv to Edi\nChann to Brest (assuming your support from Pic)\nNAO to MAO\r\n5 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I'm on now and will review the conversations... for now I'm in agreement with the suggestions you've put so much thought into. I'll review and see what I might add.\r\n6 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I'll be home soon and should thus be able to reply.\r\n7 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I'm on now.\r\n8 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Dude! You've come and gone without giving me much indications! Don't worry, I'm not holding it against you, but I really hope that we get to discuss this before the end of the phase.\r\n9 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: sorry I'm at work... so things keep coming up =(\r\n10 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: No worries mate. I understand. I should be able to stick around for the larger part of the day.\r\n11 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: alright. I've looked over everything... and though I still feel it best if we left North DMZ, I can respect your wishes in this case.\n\nwhat is your goal for Stp? I'm not clear how an attack on Stp can work if you move to barents now though. that still makes very little sense to me.\n\nI personally still think it would be more effective if you moved Ech to Iri and Lon to Ech while I moved North to Bel. I can still move Bal to Gob to give you a hand into Stp in the fall, but I don't see the move to barents as useful.\n\nlet me know if you are willing to reconsiser north, it really does not make much sense to me as it really ties me up in being able to defend Den and Hol no?\r\n12 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: You don't &really& have to defend these just yet. I think it's fairly obvious that I'm in absolutely no position to stab you at this point.\nListen, so long as you have fleets roaming the north, having that one fleet in NTH makes me feel like I can use the others for more daring endeavours. If we can see to your fleets being tied up or transformed into armies, NTH will be Dmzed right away, you have my promise.\n\nAs for the move on France: we can get him to disband in Brest since I know that Gas isn't going anywhere.\nOn that topic: Italy believes that he will get support from France into Mar.\r\n13 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: And that leaves me thinking... I might have an idea. I'll get back to you in a little while.\r\n14 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: So....\n\nItaly thinks it's getting support from Gas and so much was confirmed by France.\nFrance also told me that he intends to cover Spain with MAO.\nSo what if you didn't move to Spain? What if you moved Mar to Bur instead, with support from Ruhr and Pic, while Munich moves to Sil? Meanwhile, NAO could go to MAO with the Channel's support, Lon could move to NTH while you cover Bel with your fleet, and Nor could go to Barents. Alternatively, Lon could move to the Channel, the Channel to MAO and Norway could cover NTH and prepare the convoy in the fall. Given what you've told me so far, I take it you would prefer the second option.\n\nCause I know you're not a fan of Barents, and you might be right. My reason for the move is to be able to convoy in Nor in the fall and make St-p with an army rather than a fleet (which really means I can't help securing the line with you around Mos). If you can think of a better way to make that happen, I'm all ears. The move to GOB seems to work fine, so we could try that.\n\nI won't finalize my moves until I hear from you.\r\n15 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I think either can work. my fleets will not be a threat to you from Gob and Bel but I do see why you'd want some assurance and protection.\n\nI can go along with the mar to bur plan and if you think you can get into MAO, then you should - that should be your priority. either way works for me. as for norway, you seem certain that stp wont move to norway. why are you so sure?\r\n16 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: if you are confident stp will move to mos, why not move norway to stp?\r\n17 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Am not soooooo confident about anything! Worth a try though\r\n18 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I think Ech to MAO would be stronger in case you force him to retreat to Iri you can protect lvp\r\n19 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: i will cut bre\r\n",

England is going to be quite upset with me and might try to hit Belgium.\r\n1 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Both you and England want support in Belgium. Do you think this should be the year that I betray England?\r\n2 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I have to leave that to your good judgement. I am sort of a sitting duck at the moment due to my clash with England and the persistent attack from Italy that I can't seem to negotiate away. My self-interest says, \"yes, betray England!\" You're a good ally, you haven't lied to me, and I want you to succeed, so I think we need to look closer at the situation.\n\nWhich navy does he want to use to go to Belgium?\r\n3 GERMANY -> FRANCE: He asked if I want to be supported into Belgium. I haven't replied yet.\n\nI don't want to betray you, we work well together. Plus, I'm afraid of the English fleets. However, if I betray England now, I feel like I don't have to overwhelming naval power to force anything.\n\nI suppose one option is to accept his offer to take Belgium from you and use that build to make a fleet. If I take Warsaw, i could build two. That would put him out of the picture pretty quick. Then I could return Belgium to you when you're ready.\n\nIf you don't like that plan, I'm definitely willing to just [1139277] betray England, first by supporting you in Belgium, and next taking St. Pete's.\r\n4 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I'm going to lose Spain or Marseilles, and I can't really justify letting you betray England without a clear gain.\n\nCan you put off England for one season? I'm going to try to set a trap for Italy, but I will have to lose Marseilles or Spain for it to work. It will be hard if I lose two.\n\nIf you can't just make sure he takes BEL from the Channel.\r\n5 FRANCE -> GERMANY: By the way, I'm trying to convince him to let me live in Belgium. I've offered to leave the Irish Sea if he does. I'm more interested in his response than anything else (I'm sure he will stab me no matter what), but I thought you should know.\r\n6 FRANCE -> GERMANY: Sorry, I didn't read that right. He wants to support you! That gives you a build, but it also let's him sail into Holland. Even if he doesn't, he can probably take Belgium or Holland the following season. His key is to remove units from the North Sea coast.\n\nBe careful, Germany.\r\n7 GERMANY -> FRANCE: You're right. I can move Munich up to get more unit density there.\n\nIt sounds like you want me to go for it. Let me know what you want to in the future, and I'll be there.\r\n8 FRANCE -> GERMANY: Actually, I'd rather you didn't, at least in 1903. But you do what you think is right and best.\r\n9 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Ok, I won't this turn.\n\nIf I do take Warsaw, though, I suppose I'll build a fleet? I'll talk to you during the build phase.\r\n",

I asked italy if he planned on providing that support... that would help me in that it would let me get into ech and take Lon with ease =P\n\nbut i'm not counting on any such thing, i plan on taking ech with force if need be in the fall.\r\n3 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: How are discussions going with Italy? Did you mention something about going into Gascony?\n\nHe seems a bit paranoid about the situation, but I'm also a bit a concerned that he might smell an opportunity here.\r\n4 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: What's your take on the game situation?\r\n5 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: here is what I just sent him. for full disclosure's sake:\n\n10:42 PM alright. finally some time online.\n\nlook italy - here is the gist of things. I am at 11. to get a solo, I need 7 more. what I know is I CAN NOT get that. stp, lvp, lon puts me at 14. where will the other 4 come from? impossible.\n\nwith 14 though, I can hold a stalemate line... this one:\n\nNAO/Iri/Ech hold Bre/Bur sup Gas (6 units)\nRuh/Kie sup Mun Bal sup Ber (5 units)\nNwy sup Stp (2 units)\n\nleaves me one extra unit, but gives me an impenetrable wall so that you and austria can't decide to get rid of me. this leaves 20 supply centers on \"your\" side of my wall to split... but in the end, you two wont stab each other since it would mean a german solo.\n\nwhat I'm saying is, I promise NOT to advance past that wall... I am even willing to pull back from sil ASAP. so all i'm asking you is what is wrong with tha set-up?\n\nif you also want a draw, then you can have it on those terms... you dont even have to enter MAO you can do the following and I cant get past you:\n\nNaf/WMS hold ; Spa sup Por ; Pie sup Mar (6 units)\n\nthat is a wall I cant get past.\n\nwhat do you think?\r\n6 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: so I'm willing to pull back from Sil. my understanding is that you have offered to take Mos from Stp so that we can solidify that particular line. and I am offering you a dmz in pru/sil/boh. would you agree to those dmz's? at least until next year so we each have time t o finish off our remaining enemy?\r\n7 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: Thanks for that message outlining your stance on things. Yes, I will take Mos from Stp, and I agree to the DMZ in Pru/Sil/Boh.\n\nI definitely agree with your take on things, and I think this game will be able to boil down to a stable 3-way draw.\r\n8 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: Austria, just want to give you a heads up that my communications with italy have fallen apart. He has litterally gotten insulting and demanding at the same time, and wants to get past the [1243983].\n\nI'm not sure if u can intervene and let him know that I intend to play defensively and [598341] I am committed to our CPA and ready to finish off this game. I will even vote draw.\r\n9 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: That is quite troubling. Well, I just hope he doesn't actually follow through with doing something stupid.\r\n10 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: i'm going to try to be moderate in my moves so he does not get crazy ideas, but these are sub-optimal moves for me and may result in losses for our team if FE are working together. i hope that is not the case.\r\n",

That way, we have a good shot at taking Bulgaria (you will hopefully take it) and at the same time, I don't risk my home center. Thoughts?\r\n1 RUSSIA -> ITALY: And no, Austria has never been particularly communicative.\n\nIn terms of long term plans, I think you, Turkey and I could overcome Austria. Have you thought about going Piedmont - tyrolia?\r\n2 ITALY -> RUSSIA: How can you even take Rumania?! Turkey says no way he'll agree to me having Bulgaria, he says he must have it. Of course we could overcome Austria, but the Turk is not playing ball and I'm 100% confident Turkey would then come after me, so I don't know what to tell you.\r\n3 ITALY -> RUSSIA: PS - I'm expecting Turkey to want me to support Black Sea to Bul, so Con can also suppor that while Smy supports hold at Con. Perhaps I play along with Austria this season, and you take Arm to Ank, and then you and I can deal with the Austrian after that?\r\n4 RUSSIA -> ITALY: I don't think that will work. Turkey doesn't trust you at all. I think your best bet is to try and take Bulgaria yourself.\r\n5 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Well, as long as Turkey doesn't trust me at all, he must die, right? I can't work with Turkey like that, so if you are unwilling to fight Turkey, then I absolutely need Austria on my side, right?\r\n6 RUSSIA -> ITALY: I'm sure Turkey will trust you more once he sees you move against Austria. Look, the final decision is up to you, obviously. If you want to strike against Austria, now it is an opportune because you can force a disband by taking Bulgaria.\n\nI will be doing my part by not letting Rumania support Bulgaria. At the same time, I am considering striking against Ankara. I don't want that information to leak, though -- I'm sure you understand\r\n7 ITALY -> RUSSIA: You make no sense to me, are you even considering the situation from where I sit? It appears you are just thinking about yourself, and that isn't the genesis/basis of a solid alliance.\r\n8 RUSSIA -> ITALY: I feel like we are having a bit of a communication breakdown here. I would like to work with you against Austria as soon as possible; obviously, that is in my interests but I also feel like it is in your interests. The longer you wait, the more Austria will build (either off my centers or off of Turkey's) and the harder it will be for you to ever sucessfully move against him.\n\nSecond, if you choose to move against Austria now, I will do my best to help you. I can do that by going Arm - Ank and Sev - Rum. (I will also probably have to cover Warsaw) If you choose to not move against Austria now, I understand that -- obviously working with Austria is in your short term interest especially now that he's given you Greece. Anyway, let me know your decision: if you aren't attacking Bulgaria, I will just support hold Sevastapol instead of poking Rumania.\n\nI apologize if I wasn't clear before.\r\n9 ITALY -> RUSSIA: I'm short on time, but at the moment, I plan to stick with Austria this season, I do not want to encourage an AT against me.\r\n",

I would happily oblige that move and would then return the favor in the Fall with support to Tuscany and then in the year to come Rome.\n\ni am weighing both options. Focus on the Turk or go vs Italy. Leaning towards Italy, but let me know what you think. And good luck in the north against England!\r\n4 FRANCE -> AUSTRIA: Ah, those are both good options. Not sure how I'm heading up north. Russia threw in the towel in the north, so England will now be extremely hard to beat\r\n5 FRANCE -> AUSTRIA: Italy is certain to oust me from Piedmont, so my supporting Tyrolia to Venice is certain to fail. Either he supports or cuts Piedmont.\r\n6 AUSTRIA -> FRANCE: Do you want me to support hold Pie then?\n\nI am very open to suggestions, do you like my anti turkish move or do you have some other ideas that will benefit our alliance.\nOther possobilities.\n\nI support Pie-hold.\nwhile you get F Mar into Tyr Sea.and then in the Fall you could support tyrol into Ven with Pie and me with Triest) while you cut support with Guld Lyon Tuscany. Or something like that.\n\nI am just trying to figure out the best way of ordering our armies. what do you think we should do.\r\n7 FRANCE -> AUSTRIA: Well, Turkey is clearly a threat, as is Italy. I'm not sure how best to proceed here. I may have to wave off my attack if Tyrolia leaves. Problem is, Italy will follow you as you move against Turkey. I think you'll have to have Russia take up the slack for a time.\n\nPerhaps if Tyrolia hits Venice with supported by Triest, while I cut Tuscany. We will be guaranteed to take Venice. You'll need support from Galicia for now.\r\n8 AUSTRIA -> FRANCE: I will use Tyrol to hit Venice with support from triest and Bud supports Gal to Rum.\r\n9 FRANCE -> AUSTRIA: Cool. I'll cut Tuscany, then. Budapest is at risk, but it ought to be a risk worth taking. I suspect that holding venice won't be hard and you can take it back.\r\n10 FRANCE -> AUSTRIA: Hmm.

I think to be fair, we should just try both. So first turn you go for Munich, I'll try for Denmark or Kiel in the meantime, make sure you move to Piedmont too!\r\n2 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: Wait...if you support me to Kiel we have 3. [1209493] is sure to hit denmark so that guarantees me Kiel. Then I'll hit Berlin and you can take Munich.\r\n3 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: Also, so [1209493] is saying that I should attack you after Vance. I'm sure he's saying the same thing to you. So let's be clear. [1209493] is going to win this game unless we stand together. He has all these virtually free supplies from Austria. Adam [880397] ake a couple years to start attacking [1209493].\r\n4 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: Ok so you've got a problem in the south. It might be prudent to not take Austria's supply because doing so only increases Russian/Turkish expansion. Just take it at the last minute.\n\nAdam could go for Naples, Tunis, or if he's trying for jukes, Tyrrhenian. He wouldn't bother with Albania.\r\n5 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: MAYBE adriatic.\r\n6 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: yeah i'll talk to him and try to work something out.\n\nre: [1209493] and vance. [1209493] is trying to convince me to backstab you. i won't do it, i promise! [1209493] says: \"i'll talk to vance and get him to take back kiel and you can get holland AND belgium.\" so the solution here is you hold kiel with heligo and kiel, i'll take munich with ruhr and burgundy. it should work if vance does as [1209493] says. what do you think?\r\n7 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: Interesting. Or I could take Denmark.\r\n8 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: k i'll figure this out after retreats are done [1491054]\r\n9 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: Also there's no point in you taking Belgium and Holland. You already are going to have 3 builds. 5 isn't going to be helpful to anyone. In fact, it'll help expand [1209493] if I'm weak.\r\n",

This is what I'm planning: Nor - Swe, Swe - Ska, and Stp - Nor, possibly with Mos - Stp, but I figure you'll have more use for Moscow in the south now that England is fairly crippled.\n\nSpeaking of which, Austria's army in Vienna is mildly troublesome. Do you suspect that he'd betray you now that he has the Balkans? It doesn't look like Italy has much chance for expanding, especially once Austria really puts his hooks into Turkey. With their agreement, I wouldn't be surprised if Austria got to take at least half of Turkey's current centres.\r\n1 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: Yes, looks like AUS might be planning to focus more to the North. Not the best. Not sure what can be done about it?\r\n2 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: I will use MOS for the South probably. Not sure how exactly yet, but don't see how two armies in the North can be of any use.\n\nWhy do you suggest NOR-SWE? Doesn't it make more sense that we get both fleets in a position to attack North Sea?\r\n3 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: Yes, good point. Instead of Nor - Swe, I should move Den - Swe, and Nor - NWG. That makes a lot more sense, actually.\r\n4 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: Excellent, ok, so should I move SWE-NOR or SWE-SKA + St.p-nor?\n\nOnce I have NOR I'm happy to seal off the North, so I'll be only supporting you whichever way you say. At least I don't have any other plans for the moment?\n\nYou could actually take the NS from NOR, just as an idea.\r\n5 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: You could put Swe in Nor, but I'm worried about England attempting Denmark, that's why I think it's a good idea to put Swe into Ska; that's why I suggest Swe - Ska and Stp - Nor. I'm glad we could then seal off the north; it would be good for both of us.\r\n6 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: Ok, all is clear.\r\n7 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: OK it's almost showtime! Let me know if anything has changed from our plan:\n\nSweden to Skagerrack; St. Pete to Norway, Denmark to Sweden, Nor to NWG.\n\nThis will put your fleet in Skagerrack, your army in Norway, my army in Sweden and my fleet in NWG, locking off your northern border and giving us a headstart on England.\n\nLet me know if you'd like to do anything else!\r\n8 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: Frankly, I'd prefer to support myself to Nor. Why don't you just support yourself into NS? That's a great position.\r\n9 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: So you'd prefer to support Sweden to Norway? That would be fine with me.\r\n10 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: Please let me know if that's what you mean.\r\n11 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: You there?\r\n12 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: yes, exactly. So it's ok?\r\n13 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: Yeah dude, St. Pete S Swe to Norway is definitely fine with me. Your fleet in Norway is probably more useful there anyway--it can hit NWG, NTH, and Ska and it can cover BAR.\r\n14 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: Brilliant. Thanks\r\n",

Then we can take Bulgaria and then Black sea\r\n1 RUSSIA -> ITALY: It does make for a jumbled situation..\r\n2 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Do you have any relationship with Austria left? You could offer to support him into Bulgaria.\r\n3 ITALY -> RUSSIA: not really. Let me know what you would like to do. I'm hoping we can guarantee progress if you cut Bulgaria. Otherwise, we may have to retake Serbia, after my army disbands, which would be a shame\r\n4 RUSSIA -> ITALY: We stand a similar chance of losing Rumania on my side, if I do try to cut support and he is supporting Budapest into Rumania. I will see what I can do to establish anything with Austria and influence his moves. As it is Turkey has lost most of his trust in me, and I do not believe I can influence his decisions much at this point.\r\n5 ITALY -> RUSSIA: that is why Serbia is also cutting Bulgaria at the same time so Serbia and Romania are safe regardless\r\n6 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Ah, I missed that part earlier. That sounds good.\n\nSo, this is the plan as I understand it:\nVienna moves to Budapest with support from Trieste\nIonian moves to Greece with support from Albania\nNaples/Adriatic to Ionian with support from the other\nSerbia and Rumania move to Bulgaria\nWarsaw moves to Galicia\nSevastopol moves to the Black\nMoscow to Warsaw? Depends on talks with the German I guess\n\nThat all sound good? Have you heard anything from E/F/G about their plans this turn?\r\n7 ITALY -> RUSSIA: That is what I had in mind (I might not have mentioned the Serbia part before) I haven't heard anything but I'll ask around\r\n8 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Awesome! I feel good about this turn. Now I just need to get a feel for Germany and plot out my northern moves.\r\n9 RUSSIA -> ITALY: I'm wondering if Germany is just going to go into CD now.. I have not heard from him at all this turn.\r\n10 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Finally heard from Germany, I'm somewhat hopeful that he is working with me and moving away from my border. Hoping for the best, planing for the worst.\n\nAustria thinks I'm supporting him into Trieste, and maybe Bulgaria, I said I'd let him know on that front sometime today, after I hear back from Turkey. Turkey has said he is leaning on moving Con-aeg, Ank-con, but he would tell me that regardless of what he planned. I'm a little surprised he did not enter orders yesterday. I wonder if he might NMR this round.\r\n11 ITALY -> RUSSIA: That sounds like great work. I am wondering whether supporting Serbia to Bulgaria might make sense then. Austria will retreat to Serbia but we should be able to pick up this pieces after\r\n12 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Shoot. That's wrong. We need to take Bulgaria with a fleet. I forgot\r\n13 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Bulgaria with a fleet is definitely better. If we trusted Austria enough supporting him in this turn would be preferable to both of us pinging Bulgaria, but I really don't trust him at all and our current setup is pretty foolproof.\r\n14 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Agreed. This approach kills off two armies here\r\n15 RUSSIA -> ITALY: (Supporting Austria in would leave us in the same setup at the end of the turn with the only difference being that Austria controls 1 unit and Turkey controls 3, requiring them to work together. Coordination is not always easy, especially when people get frustrated with the game when they're down to a single unit (Austria) or backed against the wall (Turkey)). That said, I still prefer our current plan.\r\n",

I don't know how useful it is, but it might be.\n\non a second note... if you are ok with it, I'd like to move to Gas as its important to holding my stalemate line with you down the road, and it will allow me to give you MAO without a problem. I would like to hold this line: F NAO, F Iri, F Ech, U bre/bur sup Gas, A ruh/ki sup mun. what do you think?\r\n2 ITALY -> GERMANY: Every vibe I'm getting from your recent press is that you will try to solo. An army in Tryolia will not harm you and where to do you plan to go that you can't leave an army behind in Munich? Why are you wanting me to allow England to MAO, so he can help you solo? No I don't want you to move to Gascony, and why on earch would I want you to stalemate me and feel secure, Austria and I cannot stalemate each other, and that fear will force us to not stab each other since if we do then the other will help you solo. If you stalemate me, then you are free to stab Austria in the east and I cannot do anything about it. Yeah, I'm not a fan of anything you've just said, but feel free to expand on your thoughts.\r\n3 GERMANY -> ITALY: well, thank you for sharing your honest thoughts. I will expand and show you exactly where I think your fear of a German solo is completey misplaced.\n\nI'm at work now, but will do so as soon as I can because its important for me that you understand my reasoning and that i understand yours.\n\nbut mark my words. this game will be a 3way, with Germany sitting at 14 at most.\r\n4 GERMANY -> ITALY: alright. finally some time online.\n\nlook italy - here is the gist of things. I am at 11. to get a solo, I need 7 more. what I know is I CAN NOT get that. stp, lvp, lon puts me at 14. where will the other 4 come from? impossible.\n\nwith 14 though, I can hold a stalemate line... this one:\n\nNAO/Iri/Ech hold Bre/Bur sup Gas (6 units)\nRuh/Kie sup Mun Bal sup Ber (5 units)\nNwy sup Stp (2 units)\n\nleaves me one extra unit, but gives me an impenetrable wall so that you and austria can't decide to get rid of me. this leaves 20 supply centers on \"your\" side of my wall to split... but in the end, you two wont stab each other since it would mean a german solo.\n\nwhat I'm saying is, I promise NOT to advance past that wall... I am even willing to pull back from sil ASAP. so all i'm asking you is what is wrong with tha set-up?\n\nif you also want a draw, then you can have it on those terms... you dont even have to enter MAO you can do the following and I cant get past you:\n\nNaf/WMS hold ; Spa sup Por ; Pie sup Mar (6 units)\n\nthat is a wall I cant get past.\n\nwhat do you think?\r\n5 GERMANY -> ITALY: your fears are unfounded. I cant stab Austria. he has too many armies in the middle right now. there is absolutely nothing I can do what-so ever.\r\n6 ITALY -> GERMANY: Austria and I will not two-way, that's silly. I prefer you not take Gas this season, it threatens me, so if you do, I will be forced to react.\r\n7 GERMANY -> ITALY: hold up... how is that even CLOSE to being threatening to you? Pie sup Mar protects mar. Wms sup spa protects it.\n\nif you would like me to delay taking gas, I'm willing to bounce you there 1v1 for now instead of supporting myself in. but then I ask that you extend the same courtesty to me in tyrolia and simply dmz it. I'd like to be able to pull sil back without having you or austria in those 4 sensative areas of tyl/boh/sil/pru. i'm at an agreement with austria, but not yet with you.\n\nso long story short, yes, I'm willing to postpone going into gas by self-bouncing there for now. but can you please not move to tyl or self-bounce there for now?\r\n8 GERMANY -> ITALY: not self-bounce. lets have mar and bur bounce in gas so that paris can sup hold brest. does that sound good? I will be moving mun back to bur and sil will go up to berlin.\r\n9 ITALY -> GERMANY: Marseilles is busy! ;)\n\nI can tell we aren't getting anywhere fast, and I don't imagine it will matter much in the end. I will not bounce you in Gas, but I ask that you not go there. Suppose it will be clear soon enough if you are going for the solo, but in my mind you are, so I will prepare for battle, especially if you move to Gascony since I will consider that an act of war. Good luck with your plans, I wish you well.\r\n10 GERMANY -> ITALY: Wtf? Excuse me and seriously screw you. I have done everything to work with u even after YOU attacked me by trying to support france into bur. By convincing austria not to build. By making sure everything is settled.\n\nEither you are willfully ignoring the realities of this game, or you are inexperienced and don't realize a Germany in my position can not solo.\n\nI have solid agreements with austria and am dmzing boh and sil. And I'm going to try to move and eliminate england. I have told you my moves, so its up to you.\n\nIn fact, not only have you ignored my call to leave tyl alone, you are now willfully telling me you plan on going on offense against me. This is NOT the act of someone who is looking for a draw\r\n",

It's really now or never.\r\n3 GERMANY -> FRANCE: OK, supt [743039] to Nwg.\r\n4 FRANCE -> GERMANY: Thanks.\r\n5 GERMANY -> FRANCE: You know I'm lookingg to be hurt badly if this doesn't go. I would appreciate it if you didn't screw me as I move to push on the Russians. Nothingi can do if you are, but I wouudlike it if you didn't and I'll remember the kindness.\r\n6 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I'm in much the same boat, buddy. If you were to ally with Russia against me there is little I can do about it. We're both just playing the hand we're dealt and doing our best. I like going against the odds and I think it would be more fun to try to push back the Juggernaut. I'll probably move southward to help Italy as much as possible as there is little that I could do if he falls. I think we have a good chance, and I think that you and I are probably the strongest players tactically on the board. So it will be fun to see what we can accomplish.\r\n7 FRANCE -> GERMANY: As far as that goes you're an ally and I do not stab allies once I've stated as much.\r\n8 FRANCE -> GERMANY: Another favor, can you hit Tyrolia to keep Russia from backing up the Austrian against Italy? We don't want Russia in Tyrolia anyway. I'll be moving Burgundy to Marseilles and and Marseilles to Piedmont. Burgundy will remain open.\r\n9 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I think I've seen a weakness in Scandinavia. How about it if you were to go Ber to Bal (supt by Den), Then balk in bal letting it stay clear & move Den to Swe? You might end up with Swe & Nor.\r\n10 FRANCE -> GERMANY: &&Then balk in bal. letting Swe sail into Gob expecting to bounce you&& that is.\r\n11 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I agree with what you said. Late night and tired and up early to play golf, but we havetime. I'm not stabbing you. I do think I would like to help the aus against the Russians so movingg to boh.

That still stands for later in the game. If Austria takes Venice off you (and I may be able to persuade him not to) he will be stronger than me and things might start to change. ~N~ ~N~ I don't know what else I can do. France needs to be stopped quickly. If you're not part of the solution then regrettably you're part of the problem. ~N~ I could use my current position to attack you, in fact I have no choice as things stand because you won't let me through. So you have a choice, either resist me and force me to attack, or you trust me and risk the possibility that I am being deceitful and that I actually WANT to get involved in a war with you which would basically mean I am allowing France to continue to expand and probably win the game. ~N~ Perhaps I'm biased, but I think that would be a pretty paranoid and irrational assessment...\r\n1 TURKEY -> ITALY: Ionian > Adriatic might save Venice - Austria should attack with his army because he knows I want his fleet to help me with my Ionian problem. ~N~ ~N~ If you do that, it will of course let my fleet into the Ionian. ~N~ ~N~ I don't intend to attack Naples or Tunis, I just want to get my fleets in a position where they can threaten France. Ideally I would like your fleets to be threatening France too, but you're obviously paranoid so I very much doubt anything on earth will persuade you to move them away from home defence. So that's the deal. I take the game by the scruff of the neck and attack the guy who's threatening to run away with it, while you sit defending yourself from imaginary threats. I can live with that.\r\n2 ITALY -> TURKEY: wow, um, no, absolutely not. you approach me at the beginning saying to prepare to attack austria when the time is right and you completely back out of that. your scenario of runaway france is laughably overblown. and your belligerent attitude isn't likely to incline me toward your cause. if you want to match french power, you need only walk into austria's unoccupied Scs. apparently you don't want to do that.\r\n3 TURKEY -> ITALY: England isn't entering orders. Even if he did he couldn't stop France taking Liverpool and London this turn, Holland is also at risk. That puts France on 10 units, 4 ahead of everyone else. You don't think that's a really strong and dangerous position for him? Because I think you're going to find out very quickly! ~N~ ~N~ I have NOT completely backed out of attacking Austria, as I have repeatedly said. I even said at the very start \"when I feel the time is right.\" You're clearly impatient for this to be sooner rather than later, but I'm starting to worry that you just want me to screw up my own game ASAP so that your mate France can win this unopposed. ~N~ ~N~ If I'm going to attack Austria I will need your backing otherwise it's a backwards step. And you seem like you're getting cold feet about working with me, you're complaint that I'm not attacking my loyal ally is in effect becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. I certainly won't attack Austria if I'm not convinced you're going to help me finish him off!\r\n4 ITALY -> TURKEY: please, don't try to turn this around on to me. you have no real scenario for seriously challenging france by way of a couple of boats in the med. england is signed online right now. that, and the remaining german and russian units, are serious obstacles to french expansion. meanwhile, you and your ally are a much more potent force with fewer opposing units in russia. and finally, you are asking for me to let you into the ionian and instead of offering me some kind of gain, you insult me. what do you think i am going to say to that kind of message?\r\n5 TURKEY -> ITALY: So you're suggesting we just let France get on with it, rely on England, Germany and Russia (who on the face of it don't appear to be performing with great success), and hope France messes up? I'm not enamoured of that plan. ~N~ The only gain I can offer you is Greece, and I can't see how such a pointless sacrifice on my part can benefit me in the long run by giving me a chance to win the game. Basically it means your fleets are moving further east and further away from France! ~N~ ~N~ I can't believe that you can't see that unless some pressure is put on France in the south (whether by me or by you), he can get the momentum to clean up here. You've played enough games to realise that. This is winner takes all, you've got a stake invested here. I don't understand why you are playing like it's a PPS game. ~N~\r\n6 TURKEY -> ITALY: I'm not suggesting anything against your interest, I'm offering to attack France FOR you. My point of view is that France needs to be attacked, I don't care by whom. Yet you seem utterly convinced that I have some secret plan to wipe out all your units and take out Naples and Tunis and Rome - don't you see the implications of that? France would be even MORE likely to win!!\r\n7 ITALY -> TURKEY: whoa dude, accusing me of playing unethically? your proposal that i let you into the ionian was rejected on its merit, from the italian perspective, and taking into account your words throughout this game. ~N~ ~N~ however, since i have been known to get a little pissy, i won't take that much offense, but you are being as difficult with me as i am being difficult with you - to the extent allowing you into ionian is not difficult. ~N~ ~N~ i remain persuaded that france is in no substantially better position than you and austria were together, that france still has one very weak enemy, two weak enemies, two strong hostile adversaries though admittedly not immediately contiguous, and that my position, while not at all what i would like in italian position, remains defensible given what has occurred during the course of the game.\r\n8 TURKEY -> ITALY: I still think France is in a better position, he will mop up England and Germany easily, and he still has you protecting his flank and stopping anyone else from getting near him. ~N~ Whereas I am now surrounded by Russia (who I invaded), Austria (who I stabbed) and you (ally of my enemy). Unless I can persuade one of you to join forces with me, I very much fancy France's chances of winning this one very quickly. ~N~ From Austria's failure to attack you and your confidence in leaving Venice unguarded, I presume you two are now allied quite strongly. But the fact remains, you are the only one who can realistically stop France from winning, and from here it does look like you are actively helping him. I'm not saying that's unethical, it's just irrational!\r\n9 TURKEY -> ITALY: You were right about the time being right for the stab, of course. I just couldn't tell you, tempting as it was, for obvious reasons!\r\n10 ITALY -> TURKEY: i don't know about irrational - france has been an honest broker, and you admit that you didn't even live up to the one bargain you tried to strike ;)\r\n",

Afterwards I'll probably be dead.\n\nSo you win something in any case, but in the 2nd case I'm afraid I won't last long lol.\r\n9 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Never mind what I wrote earlier.\nI didn't notice the french fleet in your back.\nIf he's allied with Italy, he can come in Channel or Irish.\nYou need the build.\nTake Denmark.\n\nLet's hope Russia will back me in Munich. We're still talking.\nRemember the plan if I get him to support hold Munich:\nI disband the fleet, build an army and then you and I fight back to back to hide friendship as long as possible.\r\n10 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Russia and I have been talking a lot. I am trying to get him to reveal his moves. I told him you are covering Berlin with Baltic (so that he won't bother trying for it) and that I supported you to Belgium so that you would let your guard down in Denmark this turn.\n\nI still think the best move is for you to support Denmark to Sweden with Baltic. I will hit Norway to cut his support and you will be in there. Not sure what the purpose of hiding anything is. I am a big proponent of just going at him if we are going to go at him.\r\n11 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I'm in the middle of the fighting here, with France pushing at me, Italy most likely joining him.\nI can't fight everyone with 5 units being in the middle of the map.\nIf Russia is mad at me, I'm toast.\n\natm you and I need to get rid of France.\nWhen you have 4 fleets and France is busy with me then you can own Russia in the north.\n\nI move Baltic - Berlin, Den holds.\nYou take Denmark and then I disband to have one more army to fight France.\r\n12 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: gtg talk to you leter ;)\r\n13 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Okay that sounds reasonable. Thanks for the explanation. Will definitely work on France and you are right neither of us can afford to hit Russia right now. I am acting like I have 8 units. lol\r\n",

If you try to move with Nap without clashing properly he might instead take Nap by guessing it.\r\n1 ITALY -> FRANCE: Sorry, last time I was on was before your messages. Glad I anticipated the convoy too, though I doubt he'll let me have the Adriatic much longer. If only I'd concentrated on a naval force instead >_>.\r\n2 ITALY -> FRANCE: On the Tyr note, I could support you into Trieste (since I'm now in this for survival, rather than the win), which would force him to retreat into Budapest or disband. Win-win situation as far as I'm concerned. ~N~ ~N~ There's a good chance they'll be able to bounce it though... So I propose you contact Turkey and point out just how tenuous Russia's defences are. It would just sound like desperate begging coming from me, but from you it's as a potential ally, and one that is more set to take me over than him.\r\n3 ITALY -> FRANCE: You could even suggest he move Con-bul and Aeg-gre so that he can keep up the illusion of attacking me (through making extra room for a fleet in te next unit building phase).\r\n4 ITALY -> FRANCE: If he goes for it we can organise a forced bounce at Trieste/Venice and then we go for the stab.\r\n5 ITALY -> FRANCE: Of course we could always alert Turkey to the plan, to put him on guard and make him divert units from the western front, though I'm no sure he wouldn't see through it.\r\n6 FRANCE -> ITALY: I can't lose Tyr to attack- I think we have to support hold there. If we lose it, Munich could fall.\r\n7 ITALY -> FRANCE: Fair point, though I would think trying to turn Turkey and Russia against each other would be a good course of action.\r\n8 ITALY -> FRANCE: I'll support you into the Ionian Sea this time, see if we can catch him off guard.\r\n9 FRANCE -> ITALY: I think if Turkey succesfully stabs Russia, you will get a temporary relief then face an even stronger Turkey.\r\n10 ITALY -> FRANCE: Actually, scratch that idea, I just had a new one. If Germany moves Swe-bal and North-den, and you move one of your fleets to the North Sea/Lvp-edi... You can convoy an army all the way across to Livonia. That would be enough to break through in the north, or break up his offensive line in Germany. ~N~ ~N~ I think it may actually work, if it's timed right.\r\n11 ITALY -> FRANCE: He would be forced to defend Moscow, to prevent it from being taken, and Germany could use that to break through in Prussia.\r\n12 ITALY -> FRANCE: That would give us the advantage and him a hole in his defences. Turkey will still be a problem, but we can probably stalemate him in the Ionian if he tries anything.\r\n13 ITALY -> FRANCE: Hell, if we keep attacking him there's nothing he can do to actually take the Adriatic from me. We'd ave a unit in there if he attacked and we'd cut the support if he trid it from Albania.\r\n",

Let me discuss with him, because I'd suggest if I already have the support that you take a swing at Berlin instead.\r\n1 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: I don't think I'll have Italian support after all, nevermind.. your help into Munich would be awesome\r\n2 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: Will do. Italy will want to gobble up a share of Austria, but the thre of us could work together well. Germany thinks I am going for Berlin though\r\n3 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: Actually, I like the concept of a partnership between you, me, and Italy. If that's still appealing, I think supporting Italy into Munich will be a safer bet at this point. We can continue putting pressure on both Germany and England, and use his support into Berlin/Ruhr\r\n4 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: I would rather have Italy take Trieste and either you or I take MUN. I need support from Truedte cut. :-)\r\n5 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: Either England & Germany are allied or England will be in DEN this move. Either way, your army in MUN will limit German expaNSION. I think I have convinced him that I am headed for Berlin. Can you get Italy to attack Trieste and order your A from Bur to MUN?\r\n6 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: I'll send word to Italy, though he's not responded this turn.\r\n7 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: Italy does not seem to respond too much. I really think that a German build is bad news for both of us, and I really hope Italy will attack Trieste and/or Vienna. England tells me he wants to take DEN this turn and then move on you with his build. The problem I see with that is that he missed an opportunity to take KIE already and he is obviously working with Germany. If he does not cut support in HOL, then you have no chance of getting BEL back this turn. However, if you order A BUR->MUN with my support, you will be even. You can also brig up A MAR->BUR and order F MAO->IRI (or ENG if you want to be more conservative) and we have a great squeeze on both Germany & England regardless of whether they are allies or \"frenemies\". I would like to include Italy, but I do not want to rely on someone who does not communicate. And even if he were communicating, I would still rather see a French army in MUN. What do you say?\r\n8 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: Italy is worried about being squeezed between us. I think that is unwarranted if you really do move north and east against England/Germany, but if you support Italy into MUN then one of us will need to retake it at some point. I would actually prefer the German army in MUN to the Italian, but will gladly support your army BUR->MUN.\r\n9 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: I'll take your support into Munich then\r\n10 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: Done.\r\n11 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: Still attempting to convince Italy to move against Austria, but who knows how that will go.. no word back as yet.\r\n",

I am somewhat uncertain if I will backfill from Adriatic because of Albania... There's a good change I'm gonna see Germany in Tyrolia, so I might move Pie to Tyr to bounce. I can shuffle to Venice if it follows through.\n\nI am in a rather precarious position, haha. I appreciate the help :)\r\n1 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Btw, latest message from Germany:\n\"I will go ti Tyrolia. I might need to go East with Munich. At my east side the juggernaut is gaming strenght and is approaching my borders. I consider them to be as big a threat as EF.\"\r\n2 RUSSIA -> ITALY: A peculiar message, and a peculiar way of thinking on Germany's part. In order to fend enemies on the eastern and western fronts, I'll choose to attack the south?\r\n3 RUSSIA -> ITALY: I suspect Germany's honesty with you is a smoke screen aimed to camouflage his desire to expend eastwards. He knows we're allied and what he says to you will eventually reach me.\r\n4 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Can we delay your siege of VIE? I will need BUD to reposition to GAL. Maybe if you could move TRI into TYR with support from PIE?\r\n5 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Yes, I believe so too. He said this after I pressed. He believes that the game will end in a 4-way draw between T-R-F-E &shrug&.\n\nI do not mind that at all, but I would advise moving BUD straight to VIE? The likelihood that BOH goes to SIL is high, and we're going to be in build phase again, soon.\r\n6 ITALY -> RUSSIA: [1369594], hang on a minute! I'm tryna coordinate with Turkey as well. He's said you'd support me into Vienna - this turn or the next? I am somewhat concerned about Albania's fleet still hovering like a malevolent spirit waiting to feast upon my carcass, so I wanna proceed with everything clear in my mind, hahaha.\r\n7 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Turkey wants to support you into VIE???\r\n8 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Omg, nO SORRY. i AM SO BLIND\r\n9 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Okay, sorry! We are all coordinating, haha.\nTurkey's working with me on figuring out how to fend off France's assault. So, we both needed to confirm whether &you& would support me into Vienna - if I get Vienna, that would be an extra fleet build and change the circumstances ongoing in the Southern seas a bit.\r\n10 ITALY -> RUSSIA: However, if I do &not&, that also changes the circumstances. So Turkey wanted to know whether you would so that we can all coordinate some movements.\r\n11 RUSSIA -> ITALY: I am still committed to my promise. It's Spring, and I've only requested a delay. I will be perfectly in position to support you into VIE on time so that you can build.\r\n12 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Haha, do not worry. I know that. Thank you for your promise - we were just making sure for the plan down South.\n\nWhat I'm going to do is to bounce Munich in Tyrolia from Piedmont in the case that he goes there. I will do my best, when I can to support you in Germany.\r\n13 ITALY -> RUSSIA: I was not doubting your integrity at all, just as an aside. I was just phrasing things extremely poorly.\r\n14 ITALY -> RUSSIA: The delay benefits me too. It will hopefully come across as unexpected enough that France and Germany don't see it coming.\r\n15 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Alright! I'm glad we've cleared the air. I'm really uncertain about Germany's intentions. On the one hand, he hasn't really turned hostile on me. On the other, his seeming indecisiveness worries me in the context of the concentration of units in the north.\r\n16 ITALY -> RUSSIA: No worries, haha. I don't doubt at all - I told Turkey as much. A three-way chat would forever change this game, I swear to god. We were just running like headless chooks, trying to go through best possible option of pushing France back. I spouted off to you on the tail-end of that when everything was fuzzy around the edges, so I am sorry about that!\n\nThe context was that Turkey was asking if it would be better to take on France's offer of moving to Naples this turn, and I was saying that I do rather need Naples since I want to build a fleet there (when I shuffle into Vie in the fall). T and I are looking at a way in which we can get fleets in Tusc, Rome, Naples and Ionian to push back France. Hopefully enough to drive him back and to get some of Turkish/Italian units into France.\r\n17 ITALY -> RUSSIA: As for Germany - I do not &believe& (operative word here) that he was lying to me about his movements. It seems like he would much rather turn hostile on you than E-F, much to my chagrin. I told him he can literally take Belgium if he slips Munich into Burgundy but alas, his response was as you saw above.\n\nAt this point, his fear of a juggernaut outweighs that of E-F. I feel like even if you offered to support him into Norway at this point, I do not think he would take it.\r\n18 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Thank you for letting me knows the areas in my text that were of confusion so that I could clear it up :)\r\n",

I would like to try to free some of those forces to do something useful, but it isn't like I'm about to completely overwhelm you. Also, With Russia's build in Warsaw the more forces that I have in the region the more comfortable I would be. ~N~ ~N~ Italy wants me to attack Serbia this turn so I can cut the support to Trieste so he is probably going to attack Trieste with Tryolia and Adriatic (although he could be trying to trick me.) ~N~ ~N~ I plan on Moving Greece to the Ionian where I assume we'll bounce and Smyrna to the Aegean. The next I should either be able to take the Ionian or you can take the Adriatic.\r\n1 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: russia, italy and england i think are pretty strongly allied. i suspect russia will come down on me hard this turn, or maybe after one year0 time to finish germany off.\r\n2 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: Italy is now pretty certain that I plan on attacking him, so he probably won't attack trieste this turn. But who knows.\r\n3 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: england is talking to everyone about end game plans! bit too soon maybe. he is promising me parts of germany etc. i guess he sent you a message offering me or parts of italy? they way he stabbed germany after allying with him...doesnt look good for him\r\n4 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: I haven't heard anything from him. I feel a bit left out.\r\n5 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: Tactically do you know what you are going to do this turn? Are you going to keep the fleet in Trieste or try to take the Adriatic? ~N~\r\n6 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: worried baout russia actually. i cant allow [151052] to move tuscanny to vencie. its a tricky problem, thinking now about what to do about it\r\n7 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: What if you pushed Tyrolia back to Piedmont? Then it wouldn't be so dangerous would it?\r\n8 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: i might. but i dont want silesia and warsaw to grab galica either, ah too little to work with and too much to do!\r\n9 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: things will be a lot better when you have ionian sea under your control next year.\r\n10 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: Italy will be forced to defend. I would like to prevent the Adriatic sea from dropping down into the Ionian this turn. If he does that I would be nice if you could somehow take the Adriatic, but that doesn't look advisable.\r\n11 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: i thought i would clash with russia in galica! that was a mistake, but i couldnt take the risk of having him in galica, i will mve galica back to rumania this turn.\r\n12 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: italy correctly predicted my move to tyrolia, it was obvious. he has gone into defensive mode. seems you and england have a lot to discuss with regards to the med sea. to keep my allaince will you i will promise not to build another fleet, that whole area is your playground. ~N~ will you move armenia up to sevas? you support held last turn, russia and i are in no way friends thats for sure.\r\n",

Good thinking. Then we can try to force LYO and push in against France.\r\n2 TURKEY -> ITALY: Any word from Germany or Russia?\r\n3 TURKEY -> ITALY: We should also try to get you Tun back\r\n4 ITALY -> TURKEY: Germany has said very little. As for Russia, he's said that Gal can support Vie and asked if you and I have agreed on you bouncing/going for Trieste. He's considering a risky move and hasn't gotten back to me yet, though I mentioned I'm unsure if the move is the best idea.\r\n5 ITALY -> TURKEY: It's probably what's necessary to take some leaps and bounds. It's hard when you're exposed on two fronts like that.\r\n6 ITALY -> TURKEY: Thank you! I appreciate that. I want to get Tunis back, but I think France is going to have a pretty tight iron-fist around it... Gol is the first thing that needs to get cracked, I think since the only support it can have is Western Med.\n\nI &think& in this round, France might try and support Mars into Gol to set up for Gol support moving Gas/Spain into Mars and subsequently, Pie. But you've been more consistent with guessing moves ;)\r\n7 ITALY -> TURKEY: Like, I can't lie. If France goes Mars -> Gol and inputs the same moves this [718067] of Tunis support moving Western Med into Tyrr, I'm going to be a little bit crushed, hahah.\r\n8 TURKEY -> ITALY: No, you'll be okay, even then. If that happens, we'll bounce in TYS this turn and it'll be empty.

I'll support you into Serbia as well.\r\n1 ITALY -> RUSSIA: I was about to go into Bulgaria this year. you should be hitting budapest.\r\n2 ITALY -> RUSSIA: once we do that I'll have enough there to make sure Turkey goes next year\r\n3 RUSSIA -> ITALY: I already hit Budapest. Thught you were going Smyrna.\r\n4 ITALY -> RUSSIA: and weakens Austria. He'll be getting Trieste back off me and I can't stop that yet. We need to keep him weak. This way we get 2 off him.\r\n5 ITALY -> RUSSIA: sorry. Missed your colour in Budapest\r\n6 RUSSIA -> ITALY: We will take 2 off him if i take Bulgaria also. That way you can get Smyrna and I take Bulg and we kill 2 birds with 1 stone?\r\n7 ITALY -> RUSSIA: could you hit serbia or vienna then?\r\n8 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Could you spport Brest holding so germany doesn't grow?\r\n9 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Yeah ill take vienna.\r\n10 ITALY -> RUSSIA: if we do mine, we get 3 off Austria. Turkey we can completely crush next turn.\r\n11 RUSSIA -> ITALY: I'll let you take Bulgaria if you talk to england into not moving brest so that he doesnt lose it.\r\n12 ITALY -> RUSSIA: I can do that in Brest\r\n13 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Lt the English know.\r\n14 ITALY -> RUSSIA: I've asked him.\r\n15 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Turkey has aspirations on Bulgaria. Could Rumania support me into it?\r\n16 RUSSIA -> ITALY: yes,\r\n17 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Wait no i cant this turn. Have to support Budapest in holding.\r\n18 RUSSIA -> ITALY: It would be better to hit Smyrna. Let Turkey take Bulgaria. His foreces will be seperated and we can crush him with ease.\r\n19 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Acutally he would get a build.\r\n20 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Scratch that\r\n21 ITALY -> RUSSIA: get Amenia into the black sea. Turkey is trying for Bul, so I will be hitting Smyrna. Black sea will give you Con and Ank options next turn\r\n22 ITALY -> RUSSIA: so what you want to do? I hit Bulgaria with support, or I hit Smyrna?\r\n23 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Aye. Thats the plan.\r\n24 ITALY -> RUSSIA: What about my Aegan fleet? ~N~ Bul or Smyrna?\r\n25 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Take Smyrna.\r\n26 ITALY -> RUSSIA: done.\r\n27 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Tricked Austria into bouncing Turkey. Look at that. We win!\r\n28 ITALY -> RUSSIA: I did the same\r\n29 ITALY -> RUSSIA: ha ha\r\n30 ITALY -> RUSSIA: I can take Con with Smyrna and either Aeg or Bul, if you could hit Ank to break any support it might try to give. I can then next turn use Con to support you taking Ank with Black sea. could you support my Greece into Bul? I'll also be able to take out Trieste this turn too.\r\n31 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Sounds like you get 3 and i get 1 :P\r\n32 ITALY -> RUSSIA: scratch Trieste. I need to hold Venice or he'll take it with Triest. ~N~ That means I get 2 and you get 1 in that area. You get more the next turn.\r\n33 ITALY -> RUSSIA: and also its my effort to remove your turkish thorn. He's not bothering me there.\r\n34 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Alright. I'll support your fleet into Constan. I think you should get Trieste and Serbia and I should get Bulgaria.\r\n",

I suppose it doesn't really matter; you don't have to support Prussia to Warsaw but if it's in your interests, I'd appreciate it. I think it will be because you have adequate firepower to handle Galicia and Bulgaria and it would help the Russian fall more quickly. Let me know how you feel about that so I know what to expect.\r\n2 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: As you say, the Russian is more upset with me at the moment and there is quite a bit of jockeying for positioning in the southeast that needs to be done, so I'm afraid Warsaw will be helping out in the south this spring. You seem to have plenty of firepower for taking Stp, though, so hope it isn't a problem?\r\n3 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: No, I don't think it will be a problem. I would very much appreciate your vote for a pause. Thank you kindly.\r\n4 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: You got it, wasn't on all day. I sent a message to the Russian, he's the last one to vote.\r\n5 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: Will you be dislodging the army in Galicia? I'm concerned about a retreat to Sil or Boh.\r\n6 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: I've been struggling with that myself... I finalized my orders just for the pause, but have not decided entirely what to do... I'm wondering if War should attack Mos to bounce Liv out and then if you support an attack on Liv while sending Finland to Stp, we could kill that army, what do you think of that idea?\n\nI'm thinking if I do dislodge Gal that it would retreat back home, to Ukraine, rather than run off and bother you for a season or two, but who knows...\r\n7 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: Hello again. I hope you've enjoyed the holidays and I hope to hear from you soon.\r\n8 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: Thanks for the message, my brain isn't in this game and I forgot to [317695] and figure out what to do!!\n\nSo, right now I really like your idea of destroying the army in Livonia, so Warsaw is attacking Moscow. I am currently not supporting an attack on Gal, but again, if I change that up, I'm confident it won't go on a wild goose chase against you, it will most certainly retreat to Ukraine, don't you think?\n\nI'm locked in with War attacking Mos, but will think on the rest of my units a bit more.\n\nAny other thoughts on this season?\r\n9 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: You out there?\r\n10 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: Ready to unpause again?! :-)\r\n11 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: Yes, but I'm waiting for England. I don't want him to show up suddenly and unpause before the turns go through.\r\n12 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: Oh, sorry, I didn't see your earlier message. Attacking Warsaw doesn't cause me any trouble.\r\n13 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: OK. Good luck against Moscow (that's what I meant to write earlier). How about your other plans in the south? Still friends with Italy? He must feel a little left out with your eight supply centers.\r\n14 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: I'll get him Ank this year and hopefully keep him calm, time will tell...\r\n15 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: Hopefully we can gently push him towards France; it would be good for all three of us.\r\n16 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: I've been doing my best, but as you say, he is probably feeling a little left out and will resist a bit, at least initially. I have a good feeling about the Italian, though, I'm sure we can work things out, but I've been wrong before, of course! ;-)\r\n",

I feel like going into the Barents & attacking the French lol. My fleets above the black sea are useless so I think [1480337] try to move up underneath Ger & attack Berlin. The Ger leader wont even have time to test his cyanide capsules :0\r\n4 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: They aren't randomly destroyed, but you get to pick which one you blow up if you can't support them.\n\nYou want to move Warsaw to Livonia to stop Germany getting in there, and then use moscow to support st peters. Germany will attack St Peters with Norway/Finland at the moment.\r\n5 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: Your suggestions are true. My thoughts exactly in fact. I was just trying a little disinformation ploy thinking you might have a tentative dialogue going with Ger. You said before hand you wanted a \"strong Germany at the moment\" & might have been dropping a hint at this stage. If you had been it might have worked :D\r\n6 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: If you move Budapest to trieste with support from Vienna, serbia will give you support as well - just in case Albania supports Trieste.\r\n7 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: hmm 2hrs to go. If the French move to try & get Ger into St Peters I'm better off holding off atm.\r\n8 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: Ger will move from Munich into Silesia(If they follow up on their previous moves) If I over extend into Trieste he'll take Warsaw If he doesn't already by not bouncing in Livonia. I planned to pull back from Vie to Gali. If the French move to help in into St Peters I'll give it up but I'll try a last ditch drive into Ger proper.\r\n9 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: whilst having a chat to the French :I.. Synchronise watches I'll be back on in two hours, if I do not hear from them by 20:00 hrs Russia will be at war with Ger :P\r\n10 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I think i'll make a new account; name Neville [296774].. what do you think lol?\r\n11 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I wouldn't make a new account, you don't need to - just keep playing with the same profile and join a new game. You aren't supposed to make new accounts because it encourages people to cheat/use 2 accounts in a game, and it gets you banned.\r\n12 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: In that case, move Budapest to Trieste to cut support, and I'll try to dislodge Albania.\r\n",

And I do have defend myself against Germany, and take those final two Turkish Scs\nI am going to be giving you Budapest, but I don't want to give you any more than that, unless I gain an SC somewhere else, and we need to trade to keep the score even.\r\n2 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Would you have preferred me to have built a fleet at Stp? I decided against that because I don't want France and Germany joining together to stop the common threat. But there will still be another opportunity, I hope.\r\n3 RUSSIA -> ITALY: I was a little surprised at your builds at first glance. I expected to see two fleets, but I guess you do have three already and only one fleet can fit into the Tyrrhenian Sea at a time.\r\n4 RUSSIA -> ITALY: I really want us to keep working together. At the very least we should be aiming to reduce the number of players to three. Do you agree?\r\n5 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Beyond that, what would you like to see? And how can we achieve it?\nIf you can secure one French SC this year and I give you Bud you'll have two builds. For my part I am hoping I can at least make a net gain of one SC. That might be tricky though if I can't hold Berlin. I know it will be gone this turn but I hope to regain it by autumn.\r\n6 ITALY -> RUSSIA: I did kind of think that you might build a fleet. France could grab all of England's Scs this turn as well as getting one from Germany. At best I can take one so maybe your 3 fleets will not be enough depending on how he builds.\n\nI want BUD in the Spring, I will be moving VEN eastwards and ROM-VEN, with the intention of moving to PIE in the Autumn as long as everything continues nicely between us. For me building 2 fleets would have been a waste as I would just be clogging up all my units on the same turn so I will be able to build more fleets next year.\n\nWe need to come up with a way of reducing the amount of units we have at our mutual border while at the same time maintaining enough security to ensure no stabs occur, how do you think we can go about this? I was thinking maybe that I have a unit in SER and you have one in SEV and we bounce in RUM continuously. You place your fleet in ANK and I keep a fleet in GRE, both of which do not move. This could free up a lot of wasted resources.\n\nWhat would you like BUL to do this turn?\r\n7 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Please support Ank to Con. That would be greatly appreciated.\r\n8 ITALY -> RUSSIA: If you take CON with ANK then how are you going to take SMY in the Autumn phase? best to take it with BLA in my opinion and then you can support ANK-SMY. Let me know if you are changing that or not and also let me know about BUD etc.\r\n9 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Lol. Very good point. Did not think that one through at all. Thanks.\nBla to Con it will have to be.\r\n10 ITALY -> RUSSIA: And you will be leaving BUD this Spring?\r\n11 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Okay then. So i'll move bud to Gal. So you can take bud.\r\n12 RUSSIA -> ITALY: But please let's honor our deal, okay? If we play our cards right, we really can split this board.\nIf one of us let's the other down, then obviously new alliances are going to be made, and we are going to end up with a four player draw, or even worse five players.\r\n13 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Yes that is good. Don't worry about me going back on the deal. I know I have been pushing this issue about BUD etc. but if the 2 way is to be a reality then there cannot be more than 1 units difference between us, or either one of us could get greedy.\n\nThis way at the end of the turn I will pick up SPA/BUD while you take CON/SMY with you on 12 and me with 11, assuming that you make no further gains in Germany this year. Have you thought further about my suggestion of keeping our border minimal and stab proof?\n\nAlso I am sure this is premature and it may not even happen but if France Cds then can we agree not to take any of his centres and just finish off Germany and Turkey, a solo like that would not be great! (and if a replacement were to come in then we continue with the current plan and carve him up equally).\r\n14 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Lol that sounds like a great deal for the replacement France ;-)\nI agree to all of the above. We should be relatively stab proof after this turn, I think. Well you will from me anyway. I will actually be leaving myself a but vulnerable - but as we both know new alliances can be made - so I think the threat of that will keep us both in check. But at any rate we can tweak things if needed.\r\n15 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Maybe you should push bud out? That way I can disband the unit and build a fleet. I am hoping that will have a net gain this year but I might not. It's an option anyway.\r\n16 ITALY -> RUSSIA: I would rather you just moved out. I was thinking that we could pretend it was a really bad stab and see what France would do but I think that would be a bit pointless considering he is reasonably peaceful with both of us. I would just prefer if I could use GRE and SER as support holding units this turn just to make sure there is no funny business. The death of a common enemy often results in the break down of an alliance and I would prefer not to get caught in that situation, if we play things smooth in this turn, eliminate Turkey etc, then we will go from strength to strength.\r\n17 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Okay. I'll just move out. The pretend stab wouldn't fool anyone because you'll be supporting me to Con.\r\n18 RUSSIA -> ITALY: France will be fine with that because he will be counting on a three way draw. He'll be wanting us to remove Turkey.\r\n",

This could be the first step in direction for an future alliance, and perhaps and stab on France...\r\n2 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Ok, it sounds good to me just make sure you do as you say.\r\n3 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I will not help Turkey in any way against you (not that I can at the moment).\r\n4 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Well, I will trust you...\r\n5 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: The army at Bohemia move to Galicia . ~N~ The army at Silesia support move to Galicia from Bohemia. ~N~ The army at Livonia support hold at Warsaw. ~N~ The fleet at Denmark move to Heligoland Bight . ~N~ The army at Warsaw support move to Galicia from Bohemia. ~N~ The army at Holland hold. ~N~ The fleet at Sweden move to Denmark .\r\n6 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: move that army in norway to st.pertersburg, so we could join forces against turkey... ~N~ if you let me go out with my fleets, I could help you against France...\r\n7 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I could also support you from North Sea into Brest if you want...\r\n8 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: But could not be a good move...

He is supporting into RUM, so I can either defend RUM and let you keep BUL... or I can take BUL and keep RUM open for Russia.\n\nI'm willing to choose to let you keep BUL instead of giving RUM to Russia. Are you willing to ally with me now? Most likely, I will lose 2 centers/armies this phase (VEN and BUL), and definitely not be in the leader position.\r\n1 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: Well how would you propose said alliance would go down?\r\n2 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: Like I've been saying this entire time. You take SEV/MOSC/ETC. There are 6 centers to the north. For Turkey's that win, the high majority of the time they control St.petersburg.\n\nI've been pestering you with this offer about every turn, so this is the last time I'll bug you. I'm sure you're sick of hearing my same ol' song anyhow. :)\n\nLater,\nAH, future loser of 2 centers but still in good position to kill Russia with you.\r\n3 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: And you want me to move to Arm and leave Smyrna open?\n\nPerhaps next year I'd go with you, but I'm going to HAVE to cover Smyrna this turn. Moving out of Aeg would be very helpful for our relationship.\r\n4 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: moving out of bulgaria would be best for us... technically speaking. You really wouldn't need a fleet on the south coast there. in the future maybe we can coordinate the move.\n\nAnd no, I wasn't asking you to leave Smyrna open this turn.\r\n5 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: This would be my plan for our alliance: You move to Smyrna and bounce me, then disband Aeg, so I no longer feel threatened. Then I can safely go after Russia.\r\n6 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: I don't like that plan. What else can we do?\r\n7 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: Very little. At the very least, I want you to bounce me out of Smyrna. The only reason for you to not do this, would be to invade Bulgaria...\r\n8 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: Forget it. I was offering to let you keep bulgaria if you would move on Russia with me.\n\nI'm not going to discuss Smyrna at all.\r\n9 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: And let's not both be coy. We're both concerned about the fleet build. You want to leave it open to give you options and some secrecy into your build phase, and I don't want there to be any option to build a fleet there.\n\nSo you have 2 options. First, you can move ANK there and hope for a bounce, but if I don't move there you can't build there. Second, you can bounce CON and ANK into SMY, but you have no defense for BUL and will rely on me not attacking and give me the need for only 2 units (vs 3 if you support with CON). Third, you just leave it open and hope I don't move there.\r\n10 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: For someone who wants to be at peace, you seem like you really want to fight.\r\n11 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: I'm just upfront and being cautious about what your build choice will be. I could just take your build choice away from you... and if I'm lucky I could take BULG and have you occupy SMY (or me) and remove all fleet threats.\n\nInstead I'm offering to let you keep Bulgaria. I don't see how that makes me seem like I want to fight. I'm just being honest. I hate when players trying to be clever in chats to get to a point indirectly.\n\nYour talk about the bounce in Smyrna was mostly about the build.\r\n12 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: No. I hadn't even thought about it, but you're right, I should have. I don't expect to hold Bulgaria. What you're saying makes sense - but even if I built a fleet, it would be largely trivial - you have two fleets, which can easily stop me.\n\nThe bottom line is this: You make a good point about Smyrna. So I don't really care so much about the bounce. But if you want to be friends, you WILL disband a fleet, and you WILL let me keep Bulgaria.\r\n13 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: You make it difficult for me to leave Bulgaria alone. It's like you're trying to bait me to attack you.\r\n14 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: You need friends. I'm willing to be a friend. How is that that difficult?\r\n15 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: I will leave you Bulgaria like I said I would, but you have to agree not to build a fleet in Smyrna in return, and I will disband the fleet, and we focus on Russia.\n\nFair?\r\n16 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: I just hate it when players push too far. No offense. I have a clear option to gain/lose Bulgaria, and I'm choosing to give it to you. The least you can say is thanks or whatever and let's focus on Russia. I could have easily accepted Russia's offer and took Bulgaria and attacked you.\n\nHe has lied to me and you haven't. That's the breaker. However, if this push push push is going to be a trend, i'd rather be lied to because this chat is not fun.\r\n17 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: That's fair. I'll be moving Ank > Smy so that I can build a fleet in Ank.\r\n",

I'm guessing Mar will head to Pie, so maybe Par should support Brest to Gas?\n\nNot sure what to do about MAO, Italy will certainly attack Tyrr, I think, but not sure if North Africa will also head east, what do you think?\r\n1 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: Yes, Italy is telling me he is moving to the East and want a NAP. I don&t fully believe him, as he has been telling me lies since the beginning about moving East, but I guess he will have to move back to try to keep his home centers, so at least Mars will move to Pie and West Med will go to Tyr. Naf will probably go to Tun.\nSo, moving Bre to Gas with Par support is a good move and MAO could move to Spa with Por support. This way you can support me into Mars in the Fall (I will move Bel to Bur\nRussia is on the move, so I think you will need to defend. What are your ideas on that? Maybe we can even talk with Germany.\r\n2 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I \"agreed\" to a deal with Italy where MAO supports Spain to Por and Gas supports Brest to Paris. This means that Italy should not attack MAO (so as not to cut my support), so if we have MAO support Por to Spain and Paris support Brest to Gas while Bel hits Bur, we should be in pretty good shape! :)\n\nI have chatted with Germany about cooperating against Russia, and Germany claims to be up for it. I have offered to take Holland to Hel this spring so we have three units on Den this fall. I will either support Germany into Denmark or I will give Germany Holland while Germany supports me into Denmark, effectively taking on center from Russia and giving it to Germany.\n\nI have a good feeling about all this, but you never know in a game of diplomacy. Any additional thoughts on the plan?\r\n3 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: I think it&s a good plan, Italy will have to move Mars to Pie and West Med to Tyr Sea, so there is a good chance that Por to Spa works and also Brest to Gas, this will give us a good position on the Fall.\nAlso, have you decided what to do with Lon?\r\n4 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: Great, glad you like the plan.\n\nI'd like to take London to Pic, in case things don't go as expected this spring, it would be nice to have another unit in play. If things go well, maybe we can shift Brest into your possession this year, so you can build a fleet next year and start rebuilding your own navy? I'm going to want to focus in the north against Russia and you can focus in the south against Italy, how does that sound?\r\n5 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: I would really like to have Brest back someday, but I was hoping to get Mars first. Anyway, even if I take Brest or Mars I won&t be able to build there, so building fleets will take a long time.\r\n6 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: Yeah, it would be better to get you Mar, but if we can't guarantee it, then Brest may be an option since the sooner you get one of them back, the sooner you can start building fleets. We can reassess after spring orders go through.\r\n7 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: Yes, I am not sure how much Italy will move back, I am guessing he will move Mars Pie and Gas to Mars, so we will need Austria&s help to take Mars on the Fall and moving Bel to Bur will give Germany the chance to take it.\r\n8 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: Italy should move at least two units back, including Mar, but hopefully three. Germany taking Bel is another reason to send London to Pic.\r\n9 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: I am thinking that if everything works right I can even take Spa and Mars and you can take Bel. This will give me a build and make up for your loss on Nor and we can start to fight Russia/Germany back next year.\nAnd just to avoid any mistake, you are moving Bre to Gas and supporting Por into Spa, correct?\nItaly will be gone and it will take some time until Austria can have enough fleets to become a problem to us.\r\n10 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: Sounds great. Yep, Brest to Gas and MAO supports Por to Spain, here's hoping Mar/Westmed/Nafrica all head east! :)\r\n11 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: Well, I will be honest with you, as I think we should keep working together.\nI have got messages from all around the board asking me to attack you. I think Austria and Russia are allied now and you could also expect Germany to be joining this boat from the messages I get.\nEven Italy have offered me support into Brest and a future give up of Mars.\nI see Austria as the leading power on the game. Italy won&t be able to stop him and with Russia allied with him, I would expect Turkey to fall too.\nSo, our best option is to try to keep working together to grab some Ita/German centers and make a good defensive line and hope that sometime Russia and Austria stab each other so we have a chance to advance.\r\n12 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: But I am a litte worried with our alliance, as with an army on Pic you can just grab Bel and Par and I will be gone.\r\n13 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I'm with you 100%. We've had a troubled past, but we've allied for years now and for a common cause, so I won't screw you over. That said, how do you want to do things against Germany? Swe will surely support Stp to Norway, so in the fall Norway can hit North Sea and Germany can take Holland if Bel is not in position to support hold at Hol, though that support can be cut if Germany takes Bur. What if Hol attacked Hel while Bel supported London to Hol? Brest can still go to Gas and support hold at Paris this fall.\n\nLet me know what you think we should do and I'm up for it!\r\n14 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: I like your ideas.\nFrom what I got from Russia, he is moving Den to NS this turn so Germany can move to Holl this turn. I can support your convoy to Holl from Bel but it will probably bounce, but you can then convoy it on the Fall while EC support hold NS.\r\n15 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: The main problem with this approach is that you will probably lose a center on the end of the year, while I am not even sure to get one (maybe Spa if Italy really move his fleets back).\r\n16 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: Well, at least we have hope!\n\nHol will attack Hel while Lon convoys to Hol with Belgium support, thanks!\r\n",

I lived up to my end of the bargain, you're the one getting cold feet. ~N~ ~N~ I don't think France being honest is a good reason for giving up and letting him win. Letting anyone win is pretty irrational, especially so in a Winner Takes All game.\r\n1 TURKEY -> ITALY: &Austria, not Italy. I never said I'd stab Italy :)\r\n2 ITALY -> TURKEY: you spoke of a coordinated stab, and you are tied with france, so round and round this goes :P\r\n3 TURKEY -> ITALY: I would swap my position with France's in a heartbeat! You really should know better than to look at units alone, what's important is who has the most problems and who has the easiest ride. ~N~ As for co-ordination, it looks to me like you and Austria have been pretty well co-ordinated. Just where would I have been if I had disclosed my plans to you?\r\n4 ITALY -> TURKEY: oh really? reviewing the history of the moves, you say that our moves have been well coordinated? if that is your assessment there, it causes me to question it elsewhere all the more ;)\r\n5 TURKEY -> ITALY: Having my assessment questioned by someone who thinks France is totally harmless and unlikely to win doesn't worry me too much!\r\n6 ITALY -> TURKEY: totally harmless? you have a difficult relationship with english, duder.\r\n7 TURKEY -> ITALY: then why are you letting him grow to a disproportionately large size for someone who doesn't risk being attacked by an enemy force larger than 2? ~N~ Either a) you think he's harmless, b) you want him to win, or c) you're crazy! All three options have quite disturbing implications.\r\n8 ITALY -> TURKEY: again, english language problems, regarding the definition of disproportionate.\r\n9 TURKEY -> ITALY: Anyone who is larger than me is disproportionately large. That's what the balance of power is about, keeping everyone pretty much proportionate with each other. And seeing as he is free to grow in every direction, while I am hemmed in by enemies, I challenge you to argue that we are equally strong and I'm just as or more likely to grow larger first! Go on, I need a good laugh! ~N~\r\n10 ITALY -> TURKEY: well then its a math problem, on the definition of larger, or a spatial problem, as there are no more Scs freely available to france than to turkey.\r\n11 TURKEY -> ITALY: (sigh) Other than Edinburgh, London and Holland of course. And depending on how things go, Russia or Austria. ~N~ ~N~ I give up. Clearly you're totally disconnected with the reality of this game, you're not interested in stopping France winning, you're not interested in letting anyone else stop France winning, you're not interested in winning yourself, you're not interested in the tactical situation on the board, you're not interested in a balance of power, and you're certainly not interested in negotiating. You are doing a very good job of stopping me (along with yourself) from having any hope of winning, and I'm quite certain now that this is the extent of your interest in this game. Your name gives it away, you France-lover; it turns out this is a literal description of you! ~N~ I have tried to talk about strategy and where this game is going as you are the one player who can affect the outcome on his own, but again, you're just not interested in that. All you are interested in is arguing about semantics and mathematics. ~N~ I can't reason with someone who doesn't play rationally, and I can't bargain with someone when they flagrantly disregard their own interests. France will win, you'll probably come second and take some sense of warped pride in that. But I can't encourage that kind of game-spoiling, so when the game concludes you can attempt to defend your actions in the forum. ~N~ Meanwhile if you're expecting me to collapse, I'll fight like a dervish against you, Austria and Russia and make you earn my scalp.\r\n",

He is also planning to re-take Rumania, probably from Bulgaria, with the support of Budapest and Serbia, while Galicia attacks Ukraine. If my guess is correct, you could take Galicia by Ukraine (with the support of Warsaw) and retreat to Ukraine from Rumania.\n\nA fleet in Bulgaria would be useless. It couldn't help you to take or defend Rumania.\r\n3 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: You see it's hard to know what he will actually do, ultimately he does not trust either of us and for good reason. Hmm I misread what orders you were going to do, I thought you had suggested AEG would support but if it is going to cut GRE then I can cut SER for you. The only problem I see is that we could just keep going in circles with this for years and years. And If Austria gets a build this turn, by stabbing Italy, then he will grow really quickly and be able to take both of us out, our only hope is to take both RUM and BUL off him this turn.\r\n4 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I am not afraid we shall keep going in circles for years. Remember we have two extra units compared to previous year -- my fleet in Smyrna, which will get into the Eastern Med sooner or later, and your army in Ukraine, which should take Galicia. That's why I believe we'll be in Rumania or Greece by the end of the next year.\n\nBesides that, if Austria really attacks Italy (and he seems to be serious in that), Italy will turn against him and his fall is inevitable.\n\nTaking both Bulgaria and Rumania already this year would be great, but is this possible? I don't think so, but perhaps you've got some ingenious idea.\r\n5 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: Well if we believe what he is telling you, i.e. GAL-UKR, SER + BUD S BUL-RUM, then I can move RUM-SER, and SEV S UKR-RUM. This should lead to a bounce in RUM meaning that I will still own it and SER will be cut for you.\nIf we believe what he is telling me, i.e. BUL h, GRE + SER S h BUL (or maybe GRE-AEG) with ION-NAP, then my above moves should also be successful in both of having RUM and BUL. WAR-GAL just incase GAL supports instead of cutting. Does this seem correct to you are am I missing something?\nIf he actually makes a move on Italy and gains a build, by either taking back RUM or holding onto BUL, then he can build an army in TRI and capture VEN without Italy being able to do anything. That means Italy loses 2 units to Austria and is then torn apart by France and England/ just England, so Austria will pick up atleast one more from Italy. However if he stabs Italy and gets no builds then we are safe.\r\n6 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: Are you sure your first assumption is correct? If he supports Bulgaria to Rumania by both Serbia and Budapest, he will win Rumania I think, because an army (in Rumania) can't cut the support against itself (i.e. the support of Serbia).\n\nIf we warn Italy and have him move to the Tyrrhenian Sea and Tunis this turn, he should be able to defend (with my help) next year.\r\n7 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I'm not entirely sure, but we can wait and see what happens. I doubt that Italy will move anything back, as he will believe Austria because he will want to keep his momentum against the Englisg/French.\r\n8 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: So what's the conclusion? Your variant?\n\nAeg-gre, Bla S Con-bul, Smy-eas\nRum-ser, Sev S Ukr-rum, War-gal\r\n9 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: Yep, that's the one, fingers crossed that we take the two off him, then it should be plain sailing from here on!\r\n10 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: OK, good luck!\r\n",

I only told you. Unless you told him and he told germany. Whatever. I don't think it's worth the risk to bounce in holland now. Do you?\r\n5 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: No I dont think so either. How about we attack Belgium together this spring?\r\n6 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: Now I really do have a knife at my throat. 4 german fleets on nths. I help you take belgium and I'm toast. Especially that russia is still suspect to lean towards germany.\r\n7 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: Well I am offering you an alliance which is obviously more than what Germany is planing with his 4th fleet!!! Or what is Russia capable to do offer due to his position.\n\nIf we make an assumption that Germany will attack North Sea with either Norway or Ska there is no point for you to support me into Belgium.

May I ask why?\r\n10 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I have 4 fleets against me. He can overpower me in the north. It would be nice for support, no? Or you prefer he clean up my north for some easy centers? Your call.\r\n11 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: Well what options do we have? I am also hoping Russia will attack Germany in Norway.\r\n12 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: Not many options, because you have to cover Gascony just in case. Probably the best is for you to focus on getting in Paris and line up to take burgundy. Will Italy move to tyrolia to help?\r\n13 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: He says he will.\n\nI can cover Paris with Brest and MAO can cover Gascony. That would leave Picardy and Channel with North Sea to attack Belgium.\r\n14 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I'm going to shift to get in position to cover edinburg. I suspect Germany to give back Norway to Russia and \"retreat\" to norwegian.\r\n15 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: Germany also promised to clear some fleets from the NTHS border. If he does this, I can have some room to attack. Being able to cover EDI will help this too, and I'm sure you will feel some pressure relief of 3 fleets on EC.\r\n",

If you follow with Pie to Tyr, we should be in good shape. You can swing Paris to Bur for protection on Mar, while moving Mar to Gulf of Lyon with Western Med support. Or use Western Med to support Ionian, your call. ~N~ ~N~ In the north I can take Sweden, no issues. That leaves my fleet in Hel out of the fight. I would like to swing that through into Baltic. To do that, I need to go through Kiel. With your permission, I would like to move into Kiel this turn. ~N~ ~N~ Now, that's risky for you, but look at our position. A stab on you would sink me, as I would then have the entire board against me. Also, if I was going to stab, I could take it without asking. I am not stabbing. I just want to get my fleets to where they can be useful. ~N~ ~N~ I will support Hel to Kiel, and use Munich to support Kiel to Berlin. You support hold Munich with Bur. If the move fails, you retreat to Ruhr. In the fall, I will then have the fleets to take out Baltic Sea. You will be in Boh, with any luck. To make sure we keep the centers even, you support yourself to Munich in the fall. That way, if my move fails, you don't lose a center, and we swap Kiel and Munich, which is better for both of our security anyway. ~N~ ~N~ Think about it, and take a good look at the map. We need to get you to break Italy, but the best way to do that is to take out Germany first. That gives me better aim at Russia, and lets you move armies south. I think this is the best move, and at the least it takes care of Sweden. ~N~ ~N~ Also note that while I have the only sure gain in this plan, I am also a center behind you.\r\n1 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: I agree to the proposed move so long as ruhr stay open as I will likely have to retreat there. Although you told me to do two different things with Burgundy I'm going to assume you meant suppot hold with it and move paris to gascony.\r\n2 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: Yes, sorry, I did cross myself there. Ruhr will remain open, Paris to Gas, Burgandy support hold.\r\n3 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: I will also be support holding Tunis\r\n4 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: Noted.\r\n5 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: I think I might need another fleet.\r\n6 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: Personally I would have supported the move to Gulf with Wester Med. And I should have supported your move to Boh. That's my bad. We're getting in some trouble here, but with Germany done soon, we can pull out of it. ~N~ ~N~ You have the retreat to Ruhr, and we need to get you back to Munich. Also, Austria is doing a good job of calling your moves, so let's see if we can shake that up a bit. ~N~ ~N~ We basically need to swing a third ally. R-A-T-G is too hard to conquer between the two of us, it's 4 on 2. ~N~ ~N~ You will have to support Ruhr to Munich, and support Munich to Boh. I have a feeling that will just get my army pinched, but so be it.\r\n7 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: Well in hindsight it would have been better to support in, but it would have been better to support hold had he attacked Tunis. ~N~ ~N~ Basically, I'm wondering whether I need the army in ruhr or if it would be better to disband him and build a fleet instead.\r\n8 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I hadn't thought of that. You could move to Spain this year and build it in Mar. That actually might be more crucial, considering the fleets down there.\r\n9 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: The problem this turn is Keil. I can't move to Baltic because of the extra unit in St. Pete. I have to play a guessing game with my supports. Norway is threatened, as is Sweden.\r\n10 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: If I was to guess I would say that El [593479] would only agree to help Russia if he was getting supported back into Sweden, which means Sweden should get two supports.\r\n11 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: Yes, but will they expect me to figure that out, and go for Norway? If I lose Norway to a move from St. Pete, then I have a Russian fleet on the North Coast, and that could ruin everything.\r\n12 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: Basically its 50-50 whatever way you look at it because they will want to make a good move for them but will also anticipate your defence thus equalling it out.\r\n13 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: And whats the word on the fleet? Disband ruhr or retreat it?\r\n14 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: Disband. Go for the fleet. We need that more.\r\n",

That still stands for later in the game. If Austria takes Venice off you (and I may be able to persuade him not to) he will be stronger than me and things might start to change. ~N~ ~N~ I don't know what else I can do. France needs to be stopped quickly. If you're not part of the solution then regrettably you're part of the problem. ~N~ I could use my current position to attack you, in fact I have no choice as things stand because you won't let me through. So you have a choice, either resist me and force me to attack, or you trust me and risk the possibility that I am being deceitful and that I actually WANT to get involved in a war with you which would basically mean I am allowing France to continue to expand and probably win the game. ~N~ Perhaps I'm biased, but I think that would be a pretty paranoid and irrational assessment... ~N~ 10:05 PM Ionian > Adriatic might save Venice - Austria should attack with his army because he knows I want his fleet to help me with my Ionian problem. ~N~ ~N~ If you do that, it will of course let my fleet into the Ionian. ~N~ ~N~ I don't intend to attack Naples or Tunis, I just want to get my fleets in a position where they can threaten France. Ideally I would like your fleets to be threatening France too, but you're obviously paranoid so I very much doubt anything on earth will persuade you to move them away from home defence. So that's the deal. I take the game by the scruff of the neck and attack the guy who's threatening to run away with it, while you sit defending yourself from imaginary threats. I can live with that.\r\n7 FRANCE -> ITALY: i don't believe his threats are imaginary :-) we shall see now whether austria will allow you to keep venice. do you think he will?\r\n8 FRANCE -> ITALY: i suppose you won't be having problems making deal with austria now that he got stabbed? what are you planning to build?\r\n9 ITALY -> FRANCE: well i don't think i will have a problem. perhaps i ought to build a fleet? however i do think a defensive unit in venice would be nice. ~N~ ~N~ somehow, turkey struck. i think he suspected austria and i were both going to. i kept telling austria to strike at him, and resisted the idiotic request that i allow turkey into the ionian, and i guess that got the idea in his mind that he was going to stab with me. how about that - a stroke 'o luck.\r\n10 FRANCE -> ITALY: i also think that army in venice would be good. if you've decided to fight turkey with austria you could use ionian to convoy apulia to albania, while austria's fleet in adriatic supports you. this would be a major blow to turkey, and would allow you to advance in his direction\r\n",

I don't want to be left out of a discussion of tactics and strategy this time around.\r\n1 FRANCE -> GERMANY: Dear Germany,\n\nI was mistaken in that I thought you would re-attack me after you had captured Den and Swe. Because you had already attacked me before and because I attacked you this time.\n\nYour additional point of wanting to see another nation lose is an accurate one. I expect that perhaps more in a sum of squares setting and not so much in a winner takes all setting such as the masters. After all, if no one solos that is a loss for the one trying to solo and a win for all others. In sum of squares the incentive gets ridiculously small, it doesn't here.\n\nThe moves I have entered are:\n- Yor-edi\n- Eng-lon\n- Den-bal\n- Ruh S Bel-hol\n- Bur S Mun\n-Tyrs hold\n\nThis allows you to move:\n- Swe S Nwg-nwy\n- Ska to Den\n- Hol-kie\n- Tyr & Ber S Sil-mun\n\nYou would take Den and Mun, and should normally be able to take Nwy in such case given that Russia will need to use Bar to protect Stp. I would lose Den, but would pick up Hol and Lon normally.\n\nDo you agree on the above moves? Any thoughts or comments?\n\nKind regards,\nFrance\r\n2 GERMANY -> FRANCE: And now Ska is moving to Norway with full support.\r\n3 FRANCE -> GERMANY: That I don't get? You will leave Den open? Do you want me to move to Bal nonetheless then?\r\n4 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Dear France\n\nSorry about that. I am now finished with my work for the day. I have a job now and have had less time to deal with messages for the Master's.\nGive me a minute a a longer message and strategy discussion will be forthcoming. Since I do not intend to perish in this game.\nSincerely,\nGermany\r\n5 FRANCE -> GERMANY: No worries, Germany. Note that I am about to sign off and sleep, so may read your message only tomorrow, two hours prior to the deadline. Will check for a last time in 10min.\r\n6 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Dear France,\nI find this situation quite interesting. I wonder where my \"allies\" in Turkey and Austria are going. And what France is going to do versus what you tell me you are going to do. I cannot have a miscommunication with you at this stage in the game. And I need to survive.\nI am currently facing the end of everything. This is the truth as I see it, no beating around the bush and full honesty. I have no allies left. I hoped that my honesty with you after the Belgium move would prove a temporary speedbump in our alliance. But you took Denmark and took Edi. I feel like a made a great miscalculation with the Tactical Strategy and Social dimensions of this game to arrive at such a weak position. Denmark was especially crushing to my hopes and dreams. Unless you have managed to convert Turkey or Austria to your side. They both want to destroy you. And to be very honest with you. I was upset with you for the past several rounds when we would discuss strategy and I still end up being attacked.\n\nWhat happens when I push the Munich troop out. If I am not \"honest\" with you and you sense a \"betrayal\" you could retreat to Kiel. Sil to headed to Boh with Berlin and Tyr as support.\r\n7 GERMANY -> FRANCE: And Turkey wants me to attack you and Austria wants me to attack you. And if I don't they attack me. And if I don't help NTH SEA into Edi. That dang English get mad at me. And you want a new fleet, So is Holland under attack as well? I cant make any more mistakes. And I am disappointed that the chance for a solo is likely impossible for me. And that Austria thinks that I am an idiot for not going hostile with you sooner. Sometimes there is a play where the smaller power ( me) makes peace with the invading army(you, unless some measure of redistribution of Bases is applied) And So, I am left in an unenviable position of trying to insure my survival and trying to appease you from working with Turkey and Austria to kill me.\r\n8 FRANCE -> GERMANY: Dear Germany,\n\nQuickly before I sign off. The situation is very interesting indeed.\n\nI understand that Austria and Turkey want me dead, albeit for different reasons. Turkey wants to solo. Austria thinks I am the biggest solo threat. Turkey is the winner of that common focus on me.\n\nI also understand you need to survive. Like I told you, you attacked me, I counterattacked, and then I expected you to attack me again, which did not happen, and you ended up being the victim. I think our joint mistake was in the lack of strategic discussion the last turns, which we have definitely made up for this turn and I hope it can pay off.\n\nIn response to your question on what my moves are, I have typed my moves above plainly and honestly:\n- Yor-edi\n- Eng-lon\n- Den-bal\n- Ruh S Bel-hol\n- Bur S Mun\n- Tyrs hold\n\nAnd that answers some questions. If you move Hol-kie, you will be in Kie and I won't be able to retreat there. And you know this is not a lie as I can't take Hol and hold Mun at the same time.\n\nSo the deal I proposed was (see also my above message):\n- Swe S Nwg-nwy (which would allow you to take Nwy with near certainty)\n- Ska to Den (which allows you to take Den if you tell me to move to Bal - your last message was uncertain?)\n- Hol-kie (which covers Kie)\n- Tyr & Ber S Sil-mun (which means you take Mun)\n\nIn that case, you have your home country back PLUS the entire of scandinavia, meaning six centers. Plus Stp falls into your hands next years.\n\nI think that scenario beats any other by far. I know I am some centers ahead but at the same time am I holding the door closed in the Med Seas for Austria and Turkey, and will help you in Mun. Whereas you don't have to worry about Austria and Turkey in Stp or Scandinavia.\n\nI am signing off now. I will read your message tomorrow and hope you make the right choice of working together with me. You are right that you are my only ally left and vice versa.\n\nKind regards,\nFrance\r\n9 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Hello!\r\n10 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Yes. Could you move to the Baltic Sea. And as for England, lets kill him this turn. We can bounce at Edi with England.

You need to support yourself in, either from Ska or Nwgs, right?\r\n13 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I hope you will be able to respond to me before the deadline because your suggested moves feel like you are orchestrating me into certain moves against my own interests.\n\nI particularly don't see how you can take Nwy without support.

Germany will most likely lose two centres this year. If you want to use it and speed up your progress, you could consider Warsaw-silesia and Moscow-warsaw. It may look risky, but I think it isn't, because if your army in Rumania is dislodged and Austria moves to Ukraine, you can rebuild in Moscow.\r\n7 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: Did you tell England what moves we had planned this turn?\r\n8 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: No, I didn't.\r\n9 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: Sorry to be like this but I really do not want the plan to get leaked out as this could affect the outcome, I think England is trustworthy for now but we also have to realize that he is in a good position to stab France and I believe that this will eventually happen so not letting him in on all the secrets is a good idea, I am not sure of his relationship to Austria and Italy.\nI am considering a move west with both WAR and MOS but am unsure at the moment what I will do.\r\n",

That would be a nice start.\r\n3 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: The ENTIRE game , all I have wanted an alliance with Russia, yet, the entire game, you wanted to be in Gal, attack me, etc. and now Turkey is clearly going to take Sevastopol, and place an army there to further attack you. Italy is as good as dead, so I am the only one in the neighborhood that has the ability to help you against Turkey, so I think if you would like me to help you, instead of helping Turkey, you should move out of my SC, and cease all attacks upon me. Start with that, eh?\r\n4 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: Germany is going to get more builds. And if you are later forced to use Stp to defend Moscow, then it is going to be extremely tempting for Germany to just take all of Scan for himself. I would suggest a fighting retreat, get Rumania back to Ukraine and support Budapest to Rumania and pull Bohemia back, or disband it after you lose Sevastopol.\r\n5 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: if you continue to attack me , I will just keep helping Turkey against you, but if you STOP attacking me, I will help you against him. it's a basic choice that you have the power to make.\r\n6 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: one more thing, we will never beat Turkey unless we have naval power in the med, I can build it, if you give me my SC back, I can rebuild a med navy, and then we can beat turkey.\r\n7 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: okay, not interested in discussing? That means two builds for Turkey and they will both come from you, not from me. and the destruction of Russian south navy as well. I just do not understand your constant game long desire to attack Austria instead of Turkey.\r\n8 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I can help you to retake Serbia now and then give you back Budapest next year.\r\n9 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: and what is your proposed move to accomplish this?\r\n10 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I will be supporting Vienna to hold, because I do not trust you, AT ALL, since you have been anti Austria the entire game. So if you want Vienna, you will need three units to take it and then Turkey will get both Rumania and Sevatopol, and Serbia as well possibly. It's certain that Turkey will move to Sevastopol with support from black, and then he will hit Rumania with either Serbia or Bulgaria to cut. The other will probably support his attack on Rumania.\n\nSo first off, if you insist on attacking Vienna in force, then he could very likely get two SC from you, and even one from me, for three Turkish builds. And worse still, this will put Turkish armies in excellent position to invade Ukraine, so you will have to shift and cover unless you just want to give him Moscow and Warsaw?\n\nBut I will be relatively safe as the new Italy once France takes Tunis, France and Austria, the new Italy that is, can block turkey at sea, can you block him on land? I doubt it, because my armies in Italy will start coming back towards you to reclaim my homelands, while Turkey presses hard from the south.\n\nSo I need to see a super friendly plan from you and then you need to actually do it, and this is the last time I will talk to you, if you don't do it.\n\nThat plan needs to include removal of all Russian armies form my SC and my borders. So what is your plan?\r\n11 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I'll defend Rumania and support Tri-ser\r\n12 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: no, I am not moving to Serbia. Trieste is supporting Vienna to hold.\r\n13 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I expect to lose Serbia and gain Rome in exchange. I do not trust you at all, ZERO, so therefore, I am supporting Vienna to hold.\r\n14 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: Please provide a realistic plan that removes Russian units from my SC and borders.\n\nHere is an idea for you:\n\nRumania to Ukraine, Stp to Moscow.\nBudapest to Rumania with support from Gal.\nBohemia to Silesia.\n\nThat protects Rumania, 100% and reinforces Ukraine and Moscow to protect your homeland, and removes your units from my borders.\n\nAre you willing to do this?\r\n",

Escape route from BEL is PIC, so you need to be able to defend Brest. Further on we will not be able to keep BEL (possible situation is G army in PIC, RUH, fleet in HOL and DEN could cut NTH).\n\nMy idea (Italy's moves stay the same):\nEngland: NTH>SKA, EC>NTH, LIV>WAL, NOR S NTH>SKA (attacking SWE or DEN,), STP S MOS\nFrance: IRI>EC (to attack BEL), NAF>MAO (defending BRE), GAS>PAR, BUR>MUN, MAR>BUR\n\nAny thoughts?\r\n8 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: I had missed the the BEL > PIC eventuality.

Please share with Italy.\r\n10 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: On further review, I think I'm still going to send the fleets south. If Ruhr supports BEL, we'll just have a chain of bounces. I can cover BRE from MAO or PAR if I have to. If I do get to Munich, I can support you to BEL.\n\nI still think you should take BEL and keep control of the North Sea. SKA is premature I think.\r\n",

Austria and you can cooperate against Warsaw on the east while I can move to Marseilles-piedmont and help Austria to defeat Italy.\r\n2 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Yes! How good does that look :-)\nI think it would be great for you to start working with Austria as well. The three of us could hook up and take this game now I'm sure.\r\n3 FRANCE -> GERMANY: We have two options regarding west. Channel can convoy to Wales army from Picardie, or support Hel to north sea. You need to be careful not to lose Denmark this turn. I will help Austria in the south then, three of us will be enough to control the game, you are right.\r\n4 GERMANY -> FRANCE: You must take Wales this time. I did think of moving Bal to Den might I might move Kiel with Bal supp. My concern right now is still Russia and that he might gain the Baltic Sea, which will put pressure on my Scs next year.\r\n5 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I will convoy to British island with Channel in that case. I hope that pressure on England will be sufficient enough so he turn all units toward me and leave only Russian units for you to worry about. I looked at some diplomacy articles about strategy and you are correct, Baltic sea should stay in German hand at all costs. You could use Austrian help in dealing with Russia, so only country that can be influenced to help Austria is Turkey. I will try to talk to Turkey, he may exploit Italian and Russian weak garrison in the south and help Austria a bit. Austria is maybe beginner player so he could use your tactical advice.\r\n6 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I've heard from Turkey and he is not happy with Russia now (that fleet in Black Sea did it!) so I think is interested in working with Austria.\r\n7 FRANCE -> GERMANY: he supported Sevastopol to Romania so he must have known that only place for Romania fleet to move is the Black sea.\r\n8 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Good spot - hadn't noticed that!\r\n9 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I think I will move Kie to Den with two supports.\nIf Russia attacks Bal with both units I can retreat to Ber (or potentially Liv if he shifts Gob and no units in Stp neighbours!).\nSil is supporting austrian attack on War.\r\n10 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I think attack is best way of defense so in your place I would play:\nHel-north sea\nKiel-denmark\nBaltic-sweden\n\nThat way you will defend Denmark, and stop them from repositioning their forces. That would prove valuable next year, because they have numerical superiority in fleets, and only way they can use this superiority is to shift units around.\r\n11 GERMANY -> FRANCE: That's an interesting spin on what I was going to - use the supports to attack.\nI like it and will give it a try, as you say, may prevent Eng/Rus gaining control in the water.\r\n12 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Wt least England will have to disband something at the end of the year when you gain Lvp, which will help...\r\n13 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I hope we will have some luck in next years. The worst thing that could happen to us is eastern triple (Turkey, Italy, Russia) before we kill England. With Liverpool in my control I plan to build new fleet to swing north and try to brake through to Norwegian sea and tie up considerable English forces there.\n\nI think that in the next year if pressure on your borders remain strong we could pull little trick. Holland could move to Belgium in the fall and get yourself new army in Berlin to fight with Russia. If things are becoming really serious we might even consider moving Burgundy to Bohemia, but that would be last resort I guess. You have strong defensive position that is hard to crack, so our prime concern is Austria. He is in the middle of 3 way attack. It would be great if he could take Warsaw this turn, but that is unlikely.\r\n14 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Austria gone a little quiet this turn, but I know he has Gal-war in place, which I am supporting.\nTurkey still making friendly noises - will be interesting to see how he moves this time.\r\n15 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I am thinking about convoy to Britain, or supporting your fleet to north sea from Hel. They would both be great moves if they succeed. England can stop only one of those, so there is 50-50 chance of success. For now I have convoy in place.\r\n16 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I think best is to leave Marseilles open for build...if Austria is in problems I could build fleet there. If not I will move army there in spring.\r\n",

My concern is clear: You are asking me to leave a centre open that, if taken, would result in my utter destruction. Essentially, if you were to stab me now, I would be doomed. However, conversely, I am asking you to leave a centre open that you would be without doubt able to regain before the fall, so a stab would be utterly pointless. I know from looking at my own faults in play that I am most likely to be perscriptive in an alliance when I am about to stab. This does worry me. Hence I beg that you reconsider your idea of how we deal with St. P.\r\n1 ENGLAND -> RUSSIA: This is simple - you need to take a leap of faith! Think of it in game theory terms....if you make the \"safe\" move to STP then I will attack you and make STP my objective ~N~ If you leave it open I will help you win BER and MUN (and ask that you help me win Kiel in return). From your point of view there is a chance that I am lying about this and will just enter STP...however, the overwhelmingly highest positve expectation from your actions is from allying with me....\"le pari de Pascale\" ~N~ Also - you have got a bit lucky with Austria who has turned his attention on [151052]!\r\n2 RUSSIA -> ENGLAND: I'm sorry, I am happy to refrain from moving to St. Petersburg if, and only if, there is some reason for not doing so, rather than following my plan of me moving there this turn and leaving next. If there is some cause for genuine concern on your part should I do this, not only will I be happy to comply, but I shall also be reassured that it is a request for genuine reasons, not a ruse.\r\n3 ENGLAND -> RUSSIA: What are you sorry for? :) ~N~ there is a genuine reason - then I dont need to waste time running back to NOR ~N~ Do me a favour - dont move there (please!) ~N~ You need MOS to defend SEV anyhow\r\n4 RUSSIA -> ENGLAND: Sorry for being so taxing an ally. ~N~ ~N~ The point of my idea is that you do not have to return to Norway, because if I were to stab you to take it, you could take it back in the fall without concern, so there is no point in a stab, so I can move there and then move back, and you just need to keep a couple of units outside Norway.\r\n5 ENGLAND -> RUSSIA: no more discussion...move there if you want but if you do we will be enemies and STP will become my next objective ~N~ If you dont then we will be allies and will conquer the World :) ~N~ did you read \"le pari de Pascale\"?\r\n6 RUSSIA -> ENGLAND: I assume that is just French for Pascal's wager, with which I am familiar. ~N~ ~N~ As for Berlin, just to double check, you are attacking Kiel, and I shall attack Berlin, OK?\r\n7 RUSSIA -> ENGLAND: Looking up, I see there is no need for extra clarification.\r\n8 ENGLAND -> RUSSIA: Yes - Pascale was French! ~N~ I will take out Kiel's support - just like you forgot to do for me :) ~N~ Of course I am expecting you to support me into Kiel next turn!\r\n9 ENGLAND -> RUSSIA: why the hell didnt you defend SEV?\r\n10 RUSSIA -> ENGLAND: I thought I did, turns out I moved it... still, that shouldn't make any difference whatsoever after one year, since it would be taken this turn anyway.\r\n11 ENGLAND -> RUSSIA: not sure thats true! never mind... ~N~\r\n",

I could move there to and screw him up a bit\r\n5 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Aye.\r\n6 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Actually, I will hold this turn. Will be better for any move to be next turn\r\n7 RUSSIA -> ITALY: The move needs to be this turn\r\n8 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Otherwise he takes Munich\r\n9 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Gets too strong.\r\n10 ITALY -> RUSSIA: what are you doing to pressure him? Anything yet?\r\n11 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Galacia\r\n12 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Hopefully with approval though so that he doesn't suspect it.\r\n13 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Go for Trieste?\r\n14 ITALY -> RUSSIA: almost certainly. You going for a Budapest, Vienna or both?\r\n15 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Look at sevastopol. Turkey still hasn't let down. I have to waste resources get it back sadly.\r\n16 ITALY -> RUSSIA: I'd be just hitting him in undefended Ankara\r\n17 ITALY -> RUSSIA: or use Ukraine and Armenia to get back Sev and use Gal and Rum to get Bud\r\n18 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Too risky to stab unless I know it will work. I'll get a build in Edin this turn. As long as Austria doesn't get a build this turn (which means an attack on Trieste and Greece, then we're ok.\r\n19 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Are you attackin Greece? with Turkish support?\r\n",

Would that be a good deal for you? Pull Armenia back into Sevastapol. support it with the Ukraine if you don't trust him, but support Con into Bul with Rum\r\n9 RUSSIA -> ITALY: No, I'm using Rumania to take Budapest. And I'm taking Sevastopol back. Turkey can rot in his 3 home centers.\r\n10 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Galacia could walk straight into Vie\r\n11 RUSSIA -> ITALY: I suggest you ask for a supported attack into Greece and for Constan to cut Bulgaria. Ankara will be safe. I wil ltake Budapest and you go for Trieste. Germany will join the party soon.\r\n12 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Budapest puts me in a safer position next turn. He won't suspect it and if he does Trieste is yours.\r\n13 RUSSIA -> ITALY: And Turkey still hasnt talked to me.\r\n14 ITALY -> RUSSIA: ok. We'll see what he does\r\n15 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Turkey doesn't respond. I can't take chances with him. I will get builds this turn and we finish the attack of Austria next year. I dont think I'm ready to attack him knowing Turkey is just going to poke me all game.\r\n16 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Lock your orders quickly. Austria is starting to notice you. May pull out of a German attack and bolster his home forces.\r\n17 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Well that was easy\r\n18 RUSSIA -> ITALY: We need to start drawing borders now.\r\n19 ITALY -> RUSSIA: I want Mediteranean assets. I plan a naval fleet. You keep Sevastapol, but I get the other ones ajoining water.\r\n20 ITALY -> RUSSIA: And if the rest of the game isn't shitting themselves about the two of us then they are blind\r\n21 RUSSIA -> ITALY: You can have Smyrna and Serbia but constan not so sure.\r\n22 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Yeah. Germany is done next year, I take the sea and I'll hav [827175] and Holland.\r\n23 ITALY -> RUSSIA: you take germany and England. I want France, Italy, coastal Austria, including Serbia, and Turkey. You get Sevastapol, Rum, bud, Vie, Mun, Bel, Lon\r\n24 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Try not to focus everything on Turkey. We pretty much just need one more army and a fleet from your end and one more army from my end and we can crush em both. I'll take Budapest and Vienna this turn while you can take Serbia and maybe even Bulgaria if Turkey helps you. In the meantime you should send some pieces over to the Atlantic. Take Brest paris Por.\r\n25 ITALY -> RUSSIA: you keep Ankara too\r\n26 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Of course I keep it. That's not up for discussion. Take Smyrna with Fleet so it can't crawl up my backside. And we need to decide about Constan.\r\n27 ITALY -> RUSSIA: will be interesting to see which unit austria disbands this turn. Boh or Alb\r\n",

It would be a completely different matter if and when you turn on Turkey, against whom you continue to fail to act, in spite of the impending danger.\r\n4 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: Any action of the Austro-hungarian Empire towards Turkey would be ..what.....Romania and Serbia uselessly attacking a fortified supported Bulgaria? If you do break my Peace Treaty with the Sultan is must be effective.\r\n5 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: It once again is ceasing to be feasable to defend the home front against both Turkey and yourself, and now there is no escape to the West, so I must make an arbitrary decision, to defend against the Austrian or against the Turk. As a mark of respect to the Turk for his sound play, as apposed to the remarkably unsound tactics of yourself, I shall choose the former of the two.\r\n6 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: i had to move to warsaw im afraid, not to take it, it was clear you were moving livonia in there but i need to secure my northern border as far away from my home centres as possible. ~N~ unsound? im austria! the weak link, the lil red guy who usually dies by 1905. i do what i have to do to survive and grow.\r\n7 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: with [151052] on one side , obviously previously allied with you i had really little choice, if i had turned down turkeys offer of an alliance then you and him would have mopped me up for breakfast.\r\n8 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: Obviously previously allied with me? All I did was to suggest that rather than the long slog of a 2v2 in the south resulting in a strong Turkey we crack the Turkish nut nice and quick. After a single turn you had stabbed me, fair enough, it gave you Rumania and a better negotiating position. But then, then, you continue? And continue? And continue? You were always going to get Serbia, and other than that what have you gained? Munich. And that isn't in any way tenable; as soon as France enters Ruhr to muscle it from you your Northern ambitions are ended. So you shall make no progress, you will drop back to five centers soon enough. And there you shall stay. ~N~ ~N~ Meanwhile Turkey is expanding freely. It was long ago time enough to call a halt to Turkey. It was a good time in 1902. It was a little belated in 1903, it was urgent in 1904, now in 1905 it is all but too late to stop what you have put in motion. You have lost your opportunity to gain quickly by failing to act in 1902, 1903, you have lost your opportunity to gain at almost any rate at all by failing to act in 1903, 1904, will you loose your opportunity to survive by failing to act in 1905? ~N~ ~N~ Now is the final year, the final chance, the final opportunity, the final time where I can make a difference, but I cannot make it with your acting against me, in Galicia and in Bohemia and in Munich, attacking Warsaw, threatening Silesia, worrying England that I might fall without him gaining a share, such that he might too attack me. If I am given the freedom of defending Warsaw by your leaving Galicia, the freedom of units and security by your handing back over Munich, and the support against Turkey by your applying greater pressures on him, I can make the difference needed for Me and France and Italy and you. ~N~ ~N~ The two corner nations feed off one another's successes. When England hurts Italy, it is Turkey who gains, when Turkey hurts me, it is England who gains, when Austria is occupied by Turkish threats, as will happen in one or two years time if the status quo is maintained, it leaves France alone to be swallowed by the Empire. When England attacks France, it leaves you alone with Turkey holding you against the rough prison concrete of Budapest, the blade of his [270474] cold with the snow pressing against your neck, the Mercenaries flooding in from the Balkans, the Janissaries flooding up from Italy, the conscripts flying down from Warsaw, Turkish Warsaw to surround you, to crush you, to destroy you. ~N~ ~N~ Perhaps the time has come that you do not lie to your weakened Russian neighbor as to the movements of the aggressor in Galicia, and you awaken yourself to the terrible fate that will be yours if you do not act to stop it now, acting with, not against your other threatened brothers. Perhaps you should take heed of the wisdom from the immortal lines of Martin [180522], and act to save another, because then they can save you.\r\n9 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: All very true...but i say again what would you have me do? Uselessly batter my troops against the wall that is Bulgaria? I need italy being active in the med sea and I need you to retake sevas. OK that last one I have worked against somewhat and will rectify that if need be. but hand over Munich to you? thats not going to happen. withdraw from galica? yes that can happen.\r\n10 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: You have Italy active in the [790532]. He's battling away at all those Turkish fleets! What he needs is help from you, to push back into the Ionian, and help from me to get England to leave him by diplomacy. ~N~ ~N~ You know that Turkey is hard to strip of his assets, and it will take a long time, that is why you don't want to do it, but perhaps it is time you started for that very reason?\r\n11 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: Yes, i shall think upon it. England will stab france this year no?, that fleet in west med will be used for that surely.\r\n12 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: Well, England certainly wants me to think that he isn't attacking Italy.\r\n13 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: Well, everything except yourself is in order to stop the two corner powers. With regards to F/I/A/R, France wants it, Italy wants it, I want it, and do you want it?\r\n14 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I repeat my question\r\n15 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: You keep Moscow safe. i will attack Turkey in my own time, i will not be the sacrificial lamb that you and Italy use to weaken Turkey.\r\n",

Add your northern expansion, and my current state of being bogged down in the Balkans, and you are in a much stronger position.\r\n18 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I am going for Sevastopol this turn so just hang back. I'll take the Sea, and then we make our move.\r\n19 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: Okay, I trust you to handle this situation... I wonder if Turkey will try to defend Ankara.\r\n20 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: Yeah i'm trying to determine that. Move to Black sea or to Ankara.\r\n21 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: Hmm.... If you go to Ankara and I go to Constantinople we're bound to get one supply center, but if he goes back to the Black Sea, he can hang around and do all sorts of mischief. ~N~ ~N~ How did he even get there in the first place?\r\n22 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I left it open because I wanted to bounce myself there next turn and not risk geting in this turn.\r\n23 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: If I go Ankara and you go constan a simple Constan-ankara move will bounce us both\r\n24 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: Not Sevastopol. I meant how did he get the Black Sea in the beginning of the game? ~N~ ~N~ And that's true about Ankara. I'm really off my game tonight.\r\n25 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I may go to Ankara anyway. Italy turkey trying an attack on Greece I suppose. how you handling that?\r\n26 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: Italy actually wants a cut of Turkey.\r\n27 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: You never know. look at Aegean support to the Ionian. He may try to attack Greece with Turkish help.\r\n",

I assume Bur is heading to Mar this time and Bel to Bur?\r\n4 FRANCE -> GERMANY: As you can see from my moves I expected to lose both western med and tyrrhenian sea. My plan was to retreat to Spain and Gol and move armies to Marseilles and Gas. That would make my defence formidable. It was surprise to sea that Italy stabbed Turkey.\n\nNow we need to reconsider our tactics. If we want to have Italy or not. If we continue to fight like we did so far (GAF) we will have somewhat harder battles in front of us. If we choose to accept Italy on our side (and form [279938]) than we would have certain win but my expansion route would be blocked. That problem could be solved if you leave me corridor in St.p so I can advance through there while you go through the middle (something similar to Anlgo-german alliance). In every way I think our position is great.\r\n5 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Well, it all depends on whether Italy joins an alliance - how are those discussions going?\nAs I said before, he indicated to me that he was keen.\r\n6 GERMANY -> FRANCE: If you and Italy could work together in the south then your fleets could quickly help to overcome Turkey - you could prove your worth there and perhaps make a gain too.\r\n7 FRANCE -> GERMANY: First word about that was from you. I haven't talked to Italy about that. I will sent him massage right now to see what are his intentions, and will let you know about result. If he isn't interested I will proceed as planed. If he is we will work against Turkey together.\r\n8 GERMANY -> FRANCE: OK. If we do form a [279938] alliance then individual expansion routes will not matter so much, as long as we four work togather.\nPerhaps in your discussions with Italy you could see how he feels about Austria - I fear I will struggle to support him 'from a distance' as this game goes on.\r\n9 FRANCE -> GERMANY: What do you want with Austria? To keep him alive or to share his centres with Italy? I think Italy and Austria will have hard time to work together so probably we will need to choose one of them to be in triple with us.\r\n",

We planned the attack on Con, if Ank went to Black Sea, then Austria would have taken Ank, this way he retreated to Black Sea, which we expected, since Russia had offered to support me to Con anyway.

The last thing will be killing off England, so get to work on that one so we can call it a game! :)\r\n2 GERMANY -> ITALY: I am working on the English issue... question is if I should take Ech now or go for Nwg.\r\n3 GERMANY -> ITALY: glad things are all patched with austria.\n\nunfortunately I may not have burgundy to assist you this turn, but you can defend mar without it right? how are things looking?\r\n4 GERMANY -> ITALY: is there any chance wms might get to cut mid atlantic or no?\r\n5 ITALY -> GERMANY: If I am to defend Mar, without Bur, then I need to tap both Lyo and Spain while Gas heads back to Mar, so, nope, I can't hit MAO this season.\r\n6 GERMANY -> ITALY: yup. that's what I feared, and it makes perfect sense. if there is any other options let me know. i'm sorry I cant help with bur this turn, but hopefully it will be available moving forward into the future.\n\ni'm hoping that this turn cripples all 3 of the remaining powers. that is the goal.\r\n7 ITALY -> GERMANY: Not sure how you plan to cripple England at this point, but I hope you do, good luck with that.\r\n8 GERMANY -> ITALY: :-) I've done relatively well so far i think.\r\n9 ITALY -> GERMANY: Yeah, I'm not worried about it, I'm doing my thing with Austria while you do your thing against England, it's all good.\r\n10 GERMANY -> ITALY: and that's unfortunate... I wish I had a partner to work with, but if I share moves with you two, it could endanger me and our trust in each other further. this way, i wont have to worry that you might have told England my intentions etc.\r\n11 ITALY -> GERMANY: LOL, I can assure you I want nothing more than England's death and to insure you or Austria cannot solo. You started our conversation saying Bur cannot help me, but asked if I would help you, and I don't respond to a \"me first\" approach, I respond to all moves by all units being open for discussion and at that point I am willing to take risks for my team ahead of my own success. Hopefully we can shift to this mindset soon, but no time to do that this season, so good luck up north!\r\n12 GERMANY -> ITALY: i fully understand, and you have a very valid point. I guess I live in perpetual fear that my moves will be divulged to my enemies since most of the moves I have had to make have depended on me outguessing my opponent than forcing my way into situations. it really was me versus all 3 of my neighbors while you and Austria worked together against Turkey. but, i promise I will be more forthcoming after this turn, and you will very much like my moves (specially if they work!!)\r\n",

I'll say yes to that, but we need to sketch out where we go from here. Naturally I would like you to build fleets and attack France as soon as possible.\r\n2 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Yes it is very important that I [1139021] France this turn, as I am sure it will only be a matter of time before he sticks fleets in the Med. If I have 3 builds this turn then I could quickly turn a large army his direction and be able to neutralise him easily I should think, especially if you make a move for NS etc in the Spring of next year.\r\n3 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Just to confirm. I am supporting Aeg-bul.\r\n4 RUSSIA -> ITALY: How are we to split Turkey? if I support you Bul this turn will you help me into Con in the following turn?\r\n5 RUSSIA -> ITALY: I realize I am ahead a little now but things will be different after this turn. Most of Frances forces are up near me. Plus Germany is hanging in there. So I have a bit to worry about.\nI think your attack on France from the south will be devastating.\r\n6 RUSSIA -> ITALY: ... Devastating to France that is.\r\n7 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Yes the way I see it he will only really have one fleet in the way against my navy, so weakening him by taking POR and SPA should be easy.\n\nI was thinking I get BUD, GRE and BUL, while you take CON,ANK and SMY, that gives you 11 (12 counting DEN) while I get 10 with extra growth opportunities with France. I will be moving to BUD this turn so you can just hold there for now, it's more just to make sure you do not slip into VIE!\nBut I think you could give it to me in the next year as Turkey should be finished by that time. What do you think?\n\nI appreciate the support.\r\n8 RUSSIA -> ITALY: yes I think split could work well.tRADING you Bud for Smy is a good idea. But we talk about it in 1906.\r\n9 RUSSIA -> ITALY: One thing I can't quite see though: how will you take Bulgaria AND Greece? Or do intend to take Greece next year?\r\n",

He got an army on land. ~N~ ~N~ My suggestion is: ~N~ ~N~ Adr-apu to cut of any possible support from Apu. ~N~ Ven support Adr-apu ~N~ Tunis-ion to cut off support from ION. ~N~ Nap clashes Tyr at Rom ~N~ ~N~ Perhaps Pie Tus or maybe keep holding on to Tyr depending on my strategy with Germany..\r\n1 FRANCE -> ITALY: But you will still eventually lose Adriatic, which will probably lead to collapse unless we somehow destroy that army.\r\n2 ITALY -> FRANCE: Ok, if I move Venice to Rome and Adr-ven then I can hit him in the Spring and take him out. It will leave me open to attack from the Adriatic, but I'm going to lose an SC if I don't. So you're on your own in Tyrolia for the minute. You and Germany could always support each other too.\r\n3 ITALY -> FRANCE: And I thought he was going to try and sneak a convoy into Naples while I was moving to counter Apulia. It's what I would have done.\r\n4 FRANCE -> ITALY: I believe it is a bad idea to move Ven-rom. It will make Tyr fall, either this or next turn. Then there is no way to save Venice or rest of your land. ~N~ ~N~ My idea won't work either. He might support Apu into Ven or the other way around. The convoy basically killed your defense. It might, however, be helpful if you, before he advances further, decide to retreat Nap to Rom and try to defend your line there. You might still lose Ven, but I think I can ensure that you survive with 2 or 1 SC until Turkey falls.\r\n5 ITALY -> FRANCE: Hey, if I'm lucky he'll try for Rome instead and I can bounce him there >_>. Unlikely though. I'll go with your plan, it's got more chance of working than mine at least.\r\n6 ITALY -> FRANCE: I could support you into Trieste if you want. It would let Tyrolia through and there's a good chance of it working.\r\n7 FRANCE -> ITALY: We should come up with a clear list of what to do: ~N~ ~N~ Support into Trieste won't work, he will support hold with Serbia and Alb has no other duty than to attack Adr, perhaps with support. After a second thought, neither Ven nor Tyr seem to be defendable. ~N~ ~N~ My suggestion is that we try to fortify the west coast, that is: ~N~ ~N~ Tyr-pie ~N~ Pie-tus ~N~ Ven-rom ~N~ Nap support Ven-rom ~N~ Adr-apu (I don't think he'll try to take Ven this turn, Apu is a better position. Will most likely try to get Nap or Adr. If he gets Adr, you can retreat to Ven and that will be jolly) ~N~ Tun-ion (this way he has no support to Nap from either place!) ~N~ Tyr support Ven-rom ~N~ ~N~ If you have any objections, let me know. I think this is the best way.\r\n8 FRANCE -> ITALY: Fleet The fleet at Mid-atlantic Ocean move to North Africa . ~N~ Army The army at Tyrolia move to Piedmont . ~N~ Fleet The fleet at Tyrrhenian Sea support move to Rome from Venice. ~N~ Fleet The fleet at London hold. ~N~ Fleet The fleet at Norwegian Sea move to Barents Sea . ~N~ Army The army at Burgundy support hold at Munich. ~N~ Army The army at Yorkshire move to Edinburgh via land. ~N~ Army The army at Piedmont move to Tuscany . ~N~ Fleet The fleet at Western Mediterranean hold. ~N~ ~N~ These are my moves. Please notify me before the end of turn if you don't like the plan.\r\n9 ITALY -> FRANCE: Shit... I've got an idea. How about I go on a suicide run and you take as many of my centres as you like?\r\n10 ITALY -> FRANCE: I'm destroying Tunis this turn, make sure to take it on the next.\r\n11 ITALY -> FRANCE: Assist Apulia into Naples as well, then I'll move it back to Apu and Rome down into there.\r\n12 FRANCE -> ITALY: No, don't be stupid. I would only get Tunis, Turkey would get the rest. ~N~ ~N~ Each time you don't listen to me, we lose. If you had listened to me just now, you would have kept Ven, Nap, Rom and Tunis on a secure stalemate line. This is becoming really annoying for me. ~N~ ~N~ Disband Apu. There's only one way for us to take Nap, and that is through Tyr taking it. But you have to listen to me, otherwise we are both in trouble. ~N~\r\n13 ITALY -> FRANCE: Fine.\r\n",

Apologies for last night, it took a bit longer than usual to place orders, I thought in case I made a mistake I should warn you ahead of time. It looks good though. ~N~ ~N~ We should destroy my army in the Ukraine, but I'm thinking now we should hold back for a bit and deal with the German threat. He's asked me, by the way, for cooperation against you. I've so far showed interest, I'll see what information he gives me if any\r\n1 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: Yes, the result is good, thanks. ~N~ ~N~ German's actions may be a bit dangerous. I he cooperates with Russia (and he probably does), we may not be able to hold both Warsaw and Moscow. On the other hand, we'll get all Italian centres now -- Venice, Rome and even Tunis :-)\r\n2 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: We're doing well in the South, which should enable us to keep well supplied against Germany and the last of Russia. It's guesswork at this point however. Either Russia and Germany will direct an attack on Warsaw, or Livonia will attempt to Moscow.\r\n3 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: I'm thinking about: ~N~ ~N~ Warsaw-->Moscow ~N~ Galicia-->Warsaw ~N~ Ukraine S Galicia-->Warsaw ~N~ ~N~ What do you think?\r\n4 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: Yeah, like I said though, if Germany supports Russia into Warsaw we won't have the support. I guess than it's simply a no-gain, we can live with that. Alright, I'll support Galicia into Warsaw, sounds good.\r\n5 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: Yes, let's try it. Thank you. ~N~ ~N~ The South is obvious I think: ~N~ --- ~N~ Apulia-->Rome ~N~ Naples S Apulia-->Rome ~N~ Ionian Sea-->Tunis ~N~ Eastern Med-->Ionian Sea ~N~ --- ~N~\r\n6 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: Italy won't exist after this turn.\r\n7 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: Most definitely\r\n8 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: France is still quite weak, I'm planning to continue in that direction and cleaning out the Iberian. Until then, however, my fleets are not of much assistance against Germany or England (I will assume now that they'll ally themselves against us). ~N~ ~N~ We can get you into Moscow now, without the support of Russian Livonia. That would enable us to make a move on St Petersburg, but I'm assuming Germany is our more substantial threat at this point. If so, I'm perfectly willing to support what you need, or I guess I can even more Ukraine up into Galicia or something if you'd like the support. Whatever's fine, my army in Ukraine is just around for whatever you'd like to help you with in the North, meanwhile I'll push on in the South as far as I'm able. Bring an army West in Piedmont and we can split that up nicely.\r\n9 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: Regarding the Iberian Peninsula: ~N~ ~N~ If you take Spain, you will have to be defending it against England many turns and this would be very inefficient -- you would get a new unit in Turkey (where it is useless) and your valuable fleet in the West would be wasted. In addition, killing France would help Germany. That's why I recommend you allying with France for next couple of turns. Cooperate with him on Portugal, help him to take Brest and then take both Spain and Portugal yourself. ~N~ ~N~ Regarding Moscow: ~N~ ~N~ I would left Moscow empty as long as England has the fleet in Stp or leaves Stp empty. I also try to convince England to turn on Germany. ~N~ ~N~ I recommend you to build two fleets, because you will need a lot of them in the West. ~N~ ~N~ What do you think?\r\n",

        "intent_dialogue": "0 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Sorry, I tried to consider not building an army in Rome, but you can still shift to Tyrolia and Trieste this season to take Venice even with my army in Rome, so I just don't understand your paranoia, or at least why you should be more paranoid than I am. You say I should not need to build an army in Rome because we have Dmzs in Ven/Tyr/Tri, but if that's the case, why are you threatened by the army in Rome, I can use the same DMZ argument, so I don't get the double-standard, why the Dmzs should ease my paranoia but it's okay for you to be paranoid with the exact same Dmzs.\n\nI never did say I would not build an army in Rome, so that was never my original plan. I did consider it, but honestly, I'm not going to bend over backwards to hurry up and save Germany, my top priority is for us to be strong and the rest will play itself out, ideally with Germany, but our stability comes before the Cpas stability.\n\nI may have only one front, regarding battle, but when I have units in Marseilles and Smyrna, I'm completely spread out and vulnerable to a stab, unable to fight back. All your units are pretty much in a ball that can kick anyone's ass that messes with it. Certainly you will admit that your current situation is much more stable than mine, right?\n\nAgain, you are freaking out about Rome moving to Venice and attacking you, please try to imagine what I must be feeling since you can easily block that without breaking a sweat while I can do absolutely nothing against you stabbing me by going to Trieste and Tyrolia for Venice. Your paranoia being greater than mine makes no sense whatsoever, I wish you would see this properly, how about you ask Germany how he sees it, if you are more vulnerable to a stab by me or if I'm more vulnerable to a stab by you?\n\nIt may be illogical for you to move on me, but why is it logical that I would move on you?! How would I solo? Wouldn't me stabbing you only piss you and Germany off? Your arguments works just as well for me to make to you, if not better for me, right?\n\nI hope we can put this behind us. I will honor our Dmzs and will focus on France and taking out Ankara. Let me know your thoughts.\r\n1 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Ok, I agree. I guess you were also a bit worried about Germany. Really, at the end of the day, it's a reasonable build, but I was just caught a little offguard in hearing about it so late. I think my message back was much more paranoid than I intended it to be. I was just hoping to reason that you should feel safe enough to make the more efficient fleet build.\n\nI agree, let's just put this behind us.\r\n2 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I can't chat much right now, but I will be on later tonight to discuss further tactics.\n\nI agree we can force Ank this year and I am happy to give that to you to support your efforts against France. In the long run, we need to see off Russia and France to hold at least the [1548609] stalemate.\r\n3 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: WOW, thanks for that message, I wasn't expecting it and am very happy to hear it!! I don't have much time now either, but will late tonight, so we can go back and forth a few times to get on track, I'm excited!!\r\n4 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Ok, I'm free to play now. So, how do you want to approach Ank? Both of our proposals guarantee that Ank would fall, and I am offering the net gain to you whichever one we choose.\n\nYour proposal is somewhat more secure for you as it puts you in the driver seat to finish the move, but it also may result in Russia sitting in Black Sea after the spring. That may limit my options regarding my other moves against Russia.\n\nMy proposal would ensure that Russia remains out of the Black Sea after the spring, and we can force your army into Ank from Smy no matter what happens. He may just end up in Black after the fall anyways, but at least it prevents him from using that unit to support anything during that season.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\r\n5 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I'd like to go with my plan, partially because Ank offered to support me into Con and it will give Russia the sense that I am on his side and I should be able to get some intel out of him. That said, we know Ank will not attack Black Sea, so you could take Con to Black Sea directly if you want, but I'd like to see you attack Ank and retreat to Black Sea, that's much more deceptive and will add for some shock value when autumn orders go through! :)\r\n6 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Well, that's an interesting aspect of that plan. If Russia is indeed that dumb, then it would certainly be amusing to take advantage of that :P\n\nHas he actually offered/agreed to support your convoyed &army& into Con? I mean, the fleet from Smy would make more sense, but letting in an army is just inviting you to continue onto Ank.\n\nHas Russia given you any other interesting information?\r\n7 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Russia is desperate to get us to fight, it's worth a shot for his part, he is about to die, so I don't blame him for doing something, even if it won't work, but he doesn't need to know that just yet! ;)\n\nHe hasn't said what his other units are doing, and I try not to ask that sort of thing where I'm not involved, it would just be suspicious I think. So, he's pushing me to attack you, of course, but I just focus on Ank, especially since he offered it after I had proposed the idea to you in the first place, it sort of tied right in perfectly, ironically enough, so this should be pretty painless for the guy, he won't even see it coming.\n\nPS - He agreed to support Smyrna. I thought I could just send Smy, while I convoy Greece to Smyrna, but that wouldn't guarantee we take Ank, if Russia is actually lying to me to slow us down. What do you think I should do, just support Greece in and let on we are taking him down?\r\n8 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I think it's more likely that Russia is lying. It would be better to just support Greece in to Con, but I would still prefer that we just try my proposal in order to ensure that Russia stays out the Black Sea.\r\n9 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Yeah, I agree, Russia is likely lying, but there is still a decent chance he is not and it would be fun/interesting to play up that angle. As I guess you can tell, I'm also a bit nervous about my vulnerability in here, largely because I'm a paranoid player in general. Taking Con will ease my mind even more in here, and allow me to fully focus on France, especially since I will likely lose Mar this year. Now that I think about it, there really is no rush in you killing Russia, it's just a matter of time and we don't want you getting too bored while dealing with EF, right? What will you do once Russia is dead anyway?\r\n10 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Ok, let's go with your plan then: Convoy Greece to Con supported by Smy. I'm ordering to Con to Ank.\n\nI wish you would have felt comfortable enough to try my proposal, but I don't want to make a huge issue out of this.\n\nAs for my other moves against Russia, I think I'll have to consider something more conservative and also maybe self-bounce in Serbia. It seems that a slower approach on Russia might also make you feel more comfortable anyways.\n\nWe are both quite vulnerable to each other, but we both also vitally need each other to be successful in this game.\n\nLong-term, I just want to hold enough of Russia to ensure my half of the 17 SC stalemate that we at least need to form. If my progress on Russia develops quicker than the rest, I'll back well off the line and well away from you to avoid being a threat while EF get finished off. I need you as a partner to hold at least the other half of that line. I hope and expect that you'll be able to expand past that line in order to facilitate the demise of EF, as the 17 is of course just the bare minimum that the two of us need to make the CPA work.\n\nThe way I see it, if we betray each other, the alliance collapses into either a German solo or a larger than 3-way draw (if we ultimately get our act back together and a grand alliance forms). I hope that you agree with my view here. I just want us to be able to move forward in a efficient and trusting manner.\r\n11 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I agree, there's no rush with Russia. Thanks for agreeing to go about taking Ankara my way. I am confident we will wrap this game up relatively quickly, each season we build more and more trust and our orders reveal more and more that we are in this for the long-haul, which will be the case again this season. The AI is a very powerful alliance, though it can be fragile with the Ven/Tri situation. We are well on our way and I am feeling good about my German plans against France, my fingers are crossed, wish me luck over there! :)\r\n",

I can help...\r\n14 AUSTRIA -> ENGLAND: to kick him out of tyrolia mainly.\r\n15 ENGLAND -> AUSTRIA: well that looks nailed on... ~N~ after that? Between us we should be able to eradicate him...can we share two Scs each and then agree NAP?\r\n16 AUSTRIA -> ENGLAND: well first you need a presence in the med sea area. once we can see each other we can work together. i think 3 way draw sounds fine. goodbye germany and russia- i know you are allied with him but he is wounded and will be easier to kill that others. i guess as a nearly 100% land based power i make a good ally with england but first we need to get rid of the dead wood.\r\n17 ENGLAND -> AUSTRIA: agreed...just to clarify, I am not allied with russia\r\n",

If you were to move Tyrolia area to pie and [534255] sea to gulf of lyon then Mareilles would be yours. of course that means Adriatic sea moves to Ionian sea, retreating again to [534255] as turkey pushes you out but then next year you would have 3 fleets. My armies will be busy turning to fight off the Russian hordes\r\n2 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Tell me, what kind of relations You have with English? I know that English are planning end-game alliance with one of the southern powers, but I'm not sure with whom....\r\n3 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: me moving into GOL from Tyr would be a suicidal though, so I will not consider it\r\n4 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I will pull back my units.... now I'm pretty sure already that at least short-term, Turks/English are cooperating...\r\n5 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: true, england is very forward with his end game scenario discussions right now. i assume he is having them with all of us, they way he allied to germany then cut him almost straight away...well that doesnt make me feel too trusting towards england.\r\n6 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: he wants to discuss with me dividing up your sc! 3 to me and one to him. ~N~ ~N~ but...personallly i find that 5 -10 year promise making a bit silly, i live in the hear and now...and maybe a little bit in the future, these games are fluid. you cannot go making promises to give certain sc to people when you are no where near those sc and wont be anytime soon. i belive in strong alliances, but that comes from small deals working and trust that lead up to strong alliances. i have never played with england, in this game we have never united in nay actions...and now he wants to discuss dividing you up? i just assume he is talking to you about sharing my sc as well.\r\n7 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: actually not, he is being quite arrogant & pushes that he should be able to be provided free pass to Wmed. ~N~ ~N~ Perhaps we could start from the beginning with our relations? I think we are both relatively good players, who would be efficient in their alliance. If my gut-feeling is right, then You will face Turkish/English end-game alliance before You know. So, if You let me to be sliced between English/Turks now, You will have Turkish units in Your back yard soon enough.\r\n8 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Differently from Turkey, we could both expand in opposite directions, at the same time it would be rather easy to build up sensible & secure safety system against the stabs (which You are never able to build up with Turks).\r\n9 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I will pull out my units this turn nevertheless Your position - let me know if You are interested in developing some kind of cooperation or not.\r\n10 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: If You will take my offer for cooperation, You could move Trieste to Adriatic this turn\r\n11 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: \"relatively good\" hehehe, yeah thats what everyone says about [151052]! ~N~ relatively! thats a good one;) ~N~ ~N~ but how can you feel secure about venice and me in triest? well lets see what my limited defensive moves and your pull back look like after this turn. i cant allow you to move tus to venice. but tyrolia back to venice would be safe for your eastern border\r\n12 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: btw. Turkey has admitted working with English....\r\n13 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: ..and yes, Tyrolia will pull back to Venice\r\n14 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: really? he just told me he hasn't received any communication from england and is wondering why. that kinda confirms they must be talking a lot in my mind.\r\n15 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I would appreciate if You would leave Tyrolia empty - this would be the first good sign that You would be interested in cooperation\r\n16 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: this is Turkish last piece of communication (unless You both are pulling some kind of ploy here): ~N~ ~N~ 04:25 PM England isn't working long term with me. Like I said, I'm beginning to have bad feelings about working with the Austrians, but I think I'll play it out. If I get screwed I guess I'll learn something if nothing else\r\n17 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I think You should be worried after Armenia will replace the fleet in Sev. Some time ago Turks also told me about the possibility to swap the fleet in Greece with army & move Con to Bulgaria - this is something he could have still in mind....\r\n18 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: i assume you would keep blacking ionain as long as you possibly can.\r\n19 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: blocking\r\n20 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: some samples about English 'style': ~N~ ~N~ 04:01 PM It IS threatening I agree....but do you want it to be friendly threatening or aggressive threatening?\r\n21 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: 04:38 PM no doubt you would something different in my shoes :) ~N~ I guess I will make the mistake and reap the consequences...\r\n22 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: etc.\r\n23 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I will move Adriatic to Ionian this turn.\r\n24 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: It IS threatening I agree....but do you want it to be friendly threatening or aggressive threatening? ~N~ ~N~ thats gold! you should put it in the thread about funny one liners in games on the forum, i posted my triest to venice line there\r\n25 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: yep - after the game perhaps....\r\n26 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: about tyrolia, i cant leave that empty, well i can but i have to make some defensive move to protect myself against you having 3 units on triest next turn. if i have an army in tyrolia and triest then veince is still safe, tus can still support hold vencie.\r\n27 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: ok, but I will need one of the armies to defend Naples within 2 turns, so I hope You will move out the turn after\r\n28 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: ok, once the threat of 3 italian units on triest is gone i will leave tyrolia, possibly for Munich this fall\r\n",

I really do need that build to help Austria.\n\nalso - russia seems to think he can turn you against Austria, but I hope you can see your growth through spain, iberia, and turkey rather than through allying with russia.\n\nI look forward to helping you get your deserved builds... I know italy grows slowly and its annoying, but I will make sure to be there for you just as you have been there for me.\r\n1 ITALY -> GERMANY: I'm leaning towards supporting you into Mar, but you did initially say you'd support me in, if I can get a good read on France and that I would actually take Mar, would you follow through with that offer of supporting me in?\r\n2 GERMANY -> ITALY: Here are what I said: \"also - please do consider the ven to pied move. this will be a big deal and I may be able to help you into mar even this fall... potentially.\"\n\nand... \"Spring, 1903: Have not and will not. I look forward you getting a build. And us taking. Mar this fall\"\n\nand... \"the question is how to best handle marseilles. personally, if our alliance to hold to the end, I think mar, por, spa should be yours... but at this point, the key is to make france lose a unit. I think we can take mar and with your new build and potentially ion (unless you absolutely must move it to ems which is also a good move) you can make a more pronouned move towards france. \"\n\n\nlook, I think I've proven my point about being committed to the CPA. I helped convince Austria to stick with you, to not build last winter and to move against russia. i've been consistent on all those counts. I continue to be.\n\nI want you to know - and again this is a BIG secret I'm only telling you - that I will not be getting any other build besides Mar this year. I know you might not believe me, but I have followed through on everything so far.\n\non Mar. if you truly want me to support you in, I will. but you know that bur will get cut and likely dislodged and move us backwards and not forward. however if we can get france to disband a unit, that benefits us both.\n\nI will remain committed to giving you mar next year and helping you in any way I can take spa and por. I will rely heavily on your for fleets in the med and into the MAO...\n\nso long story short - I will be there for you.\r\n3 ITALY -> GERMANY: Well, now you have some serious explaining to do, why on earth will you not take Sweden?\r\n4 ITALY -> GERMANY: I'm getting the sense you like to give false impressions. What does \"remain committed to giving me Mar next year\" mean, besides absolutely nothing, how will you actually do it? Why on earth would I want to jump start an EG alliance, I'm happy with EF fighting a slow fight, why not get Russia on your side in the north, stretch Russia out and just take out EF together, while allowing them to fight amongst themselves? Would you even use your build for Mar to take at Russia, as you say, how will that work on not put England in complete control of the northwest? I'm getting a very bad vibe here, so talk to me!\r\n5 GERMANY -> ITALY: Hey Italy. the way I see this playing out is simple. I am going to use england to make sure france is not able to defend against you and me then I'm going to turn on a weak England as I help you take the 3 southern French centers. I'm not sure why this seems difficult to imagine. I'm already in North Sea and I will be very well positioned to continue an attack on England.\n\nwould you prefer that EF were allied?\r\n6 ITALY -> GERMANY: No, I would not prefer that EF were aligned... Count on support into Mar, and then to help me get it! :)\r\n7 GERMANY -> ITALY: thank you. great.\r\n8 ITALY -> GERMANY: You can thank me with help into Mar/Spa/Por, but the words are nice to hear too! :)\r\n9 GERMANY -> ITALY: lol. more than fair. I will do so.\r\n10 ITALY -> GERMANY: If France misses his move, you might consider stabbing England, though you'll need Mar if you try that, so up to you either way!\r\n",

Thoughts?\r\n1 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Sounds good overall; what's your plan for that? Can you support yourself into Ankara this spring and then support me into Smyrna in the fall? I'm wondering whether it's wise for us to stab Austria now as opposed to next year-- from my perspective, I can gain two builds immediately (Smyrna and Trieste), and then press an attack, but it's a highly risky proposition. I'm on the fence about it at the moment; what do you think about that?\r\n2 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Well I was thinking I'd try to take Ankara while supporting Austria into Bulgaria then have him hit Con in the fall so I'm sure to take Ankara while having his fleet support you to Smyrna.\n\nWere you thinking of stabbing Austria in the Spring or Fall?\n\nMy hope is that finishing Turkey will put us in a better position to effectively attack Austria but I would be willing to strike sooner.\r\n3 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Well, my plan was to move A Apulia - Venice this turn and A Venice - Trieste next turn, but it's not a plan with a really solid follow-up (especially if Austria gets Bulgaria), which is why I'm on the fence about it. I don't believe I'm precisely in the position where I can afford to have Austria get any more builds, personally, so is it possible for us to to get Ankara and Smyrna without actually letting him into Bulgaria?\r\n4 RUSSIA -> ITALY: I think moving to Venice would tip Austria off. I don't think we can take Ankara and Smyrna without Austrian cooperation.\n\nTo be honest, I have no idea what Austria's intentions are, I asked if he wanted support into Bulgaria and he said no...\r\n5 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Actually I could hit Con while supporting you to Smyrna in the Spring then you could hit Con while I take Ankara in the Fall.\r\n6 ITALY -> RUSSIA: That sounds great. I'm asking him, actually, if I can, using the excuse that France wants to move to Piedmont and then Tyrolia (he actually does), so I'm moving back to Venice as defence. I'll let you know what he says.\r\n7 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Austria says he's afraid I'll attack him so he doesn't want to take Bulgaria... I told him that's fine by me :)\r\n8 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Hahaha, excellent. I actually got confirmation for A Apulia - Venice, so it looks like everything is working out nicely.\r\n9 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Perhaps I should move to Galicia, he'll know it's a stab but yours will come by surprise, we may be able to take Trieste and Budapest as well as the two Turkish centres.\r\n10 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Actually, in the fall I'll be able to move into Greece and the Ionian from Naples and Tunisia respectively, so I think you can support A Greece - Serbia this turn. Or, were you planning on supporting yourself into Budapest? If we can take three of his centres this year, we'll be golden.\r\n11 RUSSIA -> ITALY: I was planning to support myself into Budapest in the fall, if you want support this turn thats fine.\r\n12 ITALY -> RUSSIA: I'm not so sure it's such a wise move to stab him right away. Alternately, you could support me into Bulgaria and Smyrna this turn itself.\r\n13 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Of course, if we're deciding on a plan, we should do so soon!\r\n14 RUSSIA -> ITALY: I'm going to support my self into Galicia\r\n15 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Unless in the next 3 min you ask for support into Serbia or Bulgaria\r\n16 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Okay.\r\n17 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Oh, asking for support into Bulgaria this turn.\r\n18 ITALY -> RUSSIA: And Smyrna.\r\n19 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Done\r\n20 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Thanks!\r\n21 RUSSIA -> ITALY: And with plenty of time, I'll be moving into Galicia still, I think that's unavoidable\r\n22 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Sure. The only thing that worries me is the possibility that Austria might retreat to Greece if he bounces with Turkey in the Aegean (I'm ousting him from the Ionian)... but we'll have to make do, I suppose.\r\n23 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Yeah, Greece is better than Serbia though.\r\n",

I think it'd probably be smarter to send Holland, but you probably don't want to leave Holland exposed. ~N~ I hope I'm guessing right!\r\n7 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Ooof. ~N~ Could have had Belgium!\r\n8 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: It'll be okay, though, I [293724] be able to push him off the island by next year.\r\n9 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Hi, I wanted to take Warsaw - and moved the other way. Good that you took Moscow - you will need this additional army in Edinburg.\r\n10 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: This is going to be a weird game; everyone is really minding their own busines except for me and France, and Austria and Turkey. ~N~ ~N~ Everyone is so defensive!\r\n",

Pic could also hit Bur, so Mar will be safe if Lyo supports hold at Mar and West Med supports MAO into Spain. Let me know what you think!\r\n1 ITALY -> ENGLAND: i was already thinking of moving with two supports to spain\nnonetheless i think that spain should eventually be mine as paris should eventually be yours\nso id be glad if you could support marseilles into spain with MAO while hitting gas with brest\nfor you it is better also to have the fleet in MAO than spain because it can quickly return to EC to fight germany\r\n2 ENGLAND -> ITALY: I really need a build this year, any way you can help out with that, rather than expecting me to only help you get a build while I get nothing this year?\r\n3 ITALY -> ENGLAND: that makes sense, so i suggest in this case we try the following which i think may work and would make the two of us happy: you try for portugal and i go for marseilles without MAO support\ni do think he will try to get marseilles back\nso the moves pic-par, bre-gas, Mao-por, mar-spa, Gol S mar-spa, wes S mar-spa would lead to high probability of getting builds for the two of us\nthoughts?\r\n4 ENGLAND -> ITALY: I have been trying to get France to trust me, even after last season, and he is at least pretending to be going along with me! ;)\n\nI have told France MAO will support hold at Spain, which France has accepted, or at least that's what France says, I don't think he really trusts me though, to be honest. Anyway, France also expects Pic to attack Bur and North Sea to attack Bel while Spain and Gas support Bur to Mar. That said, one idea would be for MAO to slide into Por, as you suggest, while Brest hits Gas, Lyo supports hold at Mar and West Med hits Spain, so that in the fall Por can support you into Spain and we each get a build like you came up with. I assume Ven will slide into Pie, so if you still want to double support Mar to Spain, that will work too, I'm guessing you'll be able to take Mar back this fall. What do you think?\r\n5 ITALY -> ENGLAND: i like your plan, and my favourite is the second option ie i strike spain this turn and try to get marseilles back the next one.. we go for it?\r\n6 ENGLAND -> ITALY: Let's do it! If Spain happens to bounce me out of Por, then Spain is guaranteed to be yours. If Bur attacks Mar and gets in, then you can easily kick him out in the fall. Alright, that build in Por is just what my doctor ordered! :)\n\nPS - I assume if I do get bounced out of Por, that Spain will support me in this fall, but please confirm.\r\n7 ITALY -> ENGLAND: yes these are the best moves\nfirst of all it is very improbable that MAO gets bounced out of portugal, but in the improbable case that it happens i will probably support you into portugal next turn\nThe reason why i say probably is because i may need spain to retake marseilles\nIn the case u have paris it is one build for you anyhow, so id need marseilles back to get a build too\r\n8 ENGLAND -> ITALY: Hmmm... Suppose that will work, though I'm not overly confident in holding Paris and I think I need a build more than you do...\r\n9 ITALY -> ENGLAND: let s play our moves and if it comes to you needing the build more than i do, then yes ill support you in portugal\r\n10 ENGLAND -> ITALY: That sounds reasonable, thanks. I must run, talk to you later!\r\n",

After Turks get out of their defensive corner, it's nearly impossible to stop them. I might imagine what would be Your reasons behind this cooperation, but as Russia still lives, Turkey will be too big before any western power can stop his advancement - and You are currently the one to destroy the western shield for Turkey...\r\n2 ENGLAND -> ITALY: Whats to understand? I havent done anything aggressive...I have only said that I want to come and support you. Your job is to keep the Turks in their corner...Im there to back you up :) (as I have said several times...sigh)\r\n3 ITALY -> ENGLAND: I just recalled that also Russians came to 'save' the Baltic states at the end of WWII from the evil Germans, bringing massive forces into our cities & then refused to leave (which was the case with most of the Eastern-european countries). Then suddenly '[41233] citizens organized' uprising, demanding that soviet armies should stay 'to protect the free [41233] citizens for a longer period' etc. etc. ~N~ ~N~ Your rhetoric sounds very much similar to the former soviet arguments. I have told You several times, that Your 'help' is not needed nor appreciated.\r\n4 ITALY -> ENGLAND: All You have achieved with Your 'help', is, that I had to withdraw my units from north, losing tactical edge against east & any possibility to defend my Sc-s in the long run. The logic behind Your moves (and benefit to Yourself) is still way too fuzzy to me & I really can't see any benefit which You could possibly achieve by strengthening AH/T alliance (which You are currently doing). You are just hoping that perhaps one of them will ally with You in the end-game when You are about to attack France. But this is all pretty much a sand-castle (as I don't see any reason why well-organized Austrian/Turkish alliance should break if they will get the edge against the western powers).\r\n5 ENGLAND -> ITALY: you hear what you want to hear....do what you want to do ~N~ I dont care whether my help is wanted or appreciated....I will look after my interests and you look after yours ~N~\r\n6 ITALY -> ENGLAND: Would You care to explain Your interests then as I haven't actually heard them since now\r\n7 ENGLAND -> ITALY: i bored of this discussion....you'll have to work it out for yourself...moving to TUN was a dumb thing to do for someone with your reputation\r\n8 ITALY -> ENGLAND: I have no idea what kind of reputation I have and what my move to Tunis has anything to do with my reputation\r\n9 ENGLAND -> ITALY: i suggest you move fleet to NAP and I move to Tyr Sea and then get you back into ION\r\n10 ITALY -> ENGLAND: I will consider it, if You uncover the reason Your fleet are in south.\r\n11 ENGLAND -> ITALY: its a peace mission\r\n",

Sounds like you're not sold on the moves, which is great, we don't want it to be obvious to everyone. You can see the Italian and I did not move on you. Italy shifted three units towards France. My biggest concern was that this autumn you would claim to support me into Warsaw while you supported yourself into Warsaw, so I did not want two of your units adjacent to Warsaw. The Russian requested that War support Gal to Sil and I had to keep his trust long enough for an autumn stab. My hope, obviously, is for Prussia to support Sil into Warsaw. England is working with you, so France will not be a problem with Italy shifting westward. I thought those moves were a perfect vision of a central powers alliance that could not be obvious to anyone but the central powers, don't you?!\r\n2 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: I've heard all of this before, [849239]. I know how you stab--smiling the whole way. This is insulting.\r\n3 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: And sure, I see how it's hidden from everyone. If you actually move to Warsaw with my support, I can see how that bounce in Trieste is also a clever move to hide our intentions.\n\nHowever, this could easily have been discussed ahead of time. I'm reasonable. I know I can still defend Berlin without a problem. If you withhold information like this, how can I trust you?\n\nWith me, better to just tell me what you want to do and why--you'll find I'm very open minded.\r\n4 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: And thanks for your help convincing Italy to move on France.\r\n5 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: First off, don't call me [849239], this is an anonymous game and you don't know who I am!! ;-)\n\nRegardless, if you know me, you know I react to the game. I try to come up with plans and see into the future, but ultimately I must react to the game. If you think I am stabbing you and think I am insulting you, that plays a big role in my decision making process. I believe the point is that you can still defend Berlin without a problem, I'm not after Berlin or any of your centers! The way you can trust me is to support Silesia into Warsaw, that seems simple enough to me.\n\nAs far as you, I had no idea who you were, so you certainly must tell me the best way to work with you, but even that must be taken with a grain of salt, obviously. I think the fact that Italy moved on France says quite a bit about our intentions as well as the fact that Italy didn't attack Tyrolia, don't you? I still don't really get how freaked out you are, but I guess I'm not the one with someone else next to my home supply centers... OH, WAIT, I got TWO others next to my centers!! Not sure where I'm going, other than in this game, you are forced to trust, the trick is trusting the right person/people, and at this moment I have no idea who that is...\r\n6 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: Yes, I will support Silesia into Warsaw with Prussia and uphold my end of the bargain. I know that I won't lose Berlin and this plays a big part in my decision. I can also appreciate the good relationship we have with Italy and the smart way in which we've hidden our alliance, so yes, you will definitely have my support into Warsaw. Take Warsaw, and grow with me. I can appreciate your unconventional methods and also respect that they are effective, so let's continue to work together.\n\nThank you for taking the time to address my concerns.\r\n7 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: And please forgive if I sounded frantic earlier.\r\n8 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: Alright, glad we're on track! No worries, I freak out often, it's my knee-jerk reaction, but a little bit of time is often all that's needed to put everything back into perspective.\r\n9 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: No problem. I'm glad we're back on the same page. Prussia is set to support Silesia to Warsaw.\r\n10 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: Perfect, thanks!\r\n11 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: I'm finalized.\r\n12 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: The Russian is going to be very pissed at me, but this season will really crush him, taking away one of his units, he'll be crippled beyond repair and hopefully the Turk will be down to one unit, it's always good to kill a Jugg, especially for us!\r\n",

I figure we'll stick with Germany, at least a little bit, but England could be very useful against France, so I figure the more options the better!\r\n1 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Yeah, geographically I think Germany works better for us. Despite his behavior earlier, he's been very forthcoming lately- I guess extreme danger will do that to a person!\nBut using England to help demolish France would be great if we can manage it. Work on him!\nNow that it's move time, do you have any plans or requests? I was thinking we could send Ionian to Tyr, and I could move Nap into Ion behind it. That may keep France guessing... It probably wouldn't but it might be worth a try... Then again I was planning on sending Rome to Tus, too, so there probably isn't much point in deception.\nAnyway, thoughts?\r\n2 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I'm open to whatever and Ion will order whatever you want. I think the quickest way to move on France would be for Tunis to hit North Africa (rather than risk bouncing in West Med) while Ion moves into Tunis, Rome to Tus and Naples to Tyrr. The plan would obviously be for my fleet to take West Med in the autumn, thus leaving Tunis free and Adr could even go to Ion this spring. BUT, as far as I'm concerned, dealing with France is completely up to you and Ion will do whatever you want without question, so it's your call.\n\nRum will go to Ukraine, since that's a guarantee and then I'll shift into Rum and move units north. Killing Russia will be pretty straight-forward, then it'll be up to you and Germany to gain the upperhand in the north/west, and hello 4,000+ points!\r\n3 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: FYI - Ion is ordered to go to Tyrrhenian for now, let me know if you'd like to adjust that.\r\n4 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I think the move to Tunis makes sense. Given France's pattern, I assumed at worst he'd backtrack to GOL, but I've also never threatened from Tunis before, so I think your suggestion is the best option.\nDo you still want me to move to Arm? Or are you going to proceed with Russia on your own?\nAlso, pretty soon we're going to want to decide on our Germany-policy. He's been better, and 4k pts is an awfully big reward for a game. But... I mean, 7k is even better.\n&Sigh& I guess we can see how he works out.\r\n5 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Okay, I'll update orders to attack Tunis.\n\nYes, I would like you to move to Arm, but you don't need to if you don't want to. I don't expect Russia will need anything from Moscow and Rum will slide into Ukraine... Well, hell, maybe Mos will just support Rum to Sev this spring and be done with it, then we just have to sit on our centers, so feel free to hold in Ank!\n\nYou are right, 7k is better, I just don't want to go for a two-way and get stuck with a four-way, you know? We can play it by ear.\n\nSo, if I take Bud and Sev, I need to get you another center. I'd like it to be Con, but we'll have to defend against Sev in Black Sea, so that won't work. I assume Tyrolia will move to Pie, so I guess your options are Vie or Bud? Vie can get into Tyrolia, or maybe Boh would be better, to support hold at Munich, but I'll discuss with Germany. Let me know what you think.\r\n6 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I'll move to Arm. I'm not hugely worried about a build this turn, I'm sure any one of those will be workable come fall. Once we see what Russia, France and Germany do we can pick which Sc's are most logical.\r\n7 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: That works for me.\r\n8 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Hey, you never said if you care about Vie going to Tyrolia or Bohemia, do you have a preference or should I just stay in Vie? I assume Tyrolia will go to Piedmont and don't want Germany to think I'm trying to get in position on him by going to Bohemia, but it probably doesn't matter too much.\r\n9 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Hmm... Have you heard anything from Germany on that? My preference wold be for Boh, but it doesn't matter a whole lot, ultimately. Boh might have the advantage again of maybe obscuring our intentions regarding Germany, but that might freak out Germany as much as it distracts France... It's your call.\r\n10 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I read back to see what Germany said and he said he didn't mind Tyrolia and he didn't comment on my idea of going to Bohemia, so I'll just head to Boh and we can sort it out later if need be.\r\n",

I don't think he will be too happy with a win for me, as he is of equal strength.\r\n15 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: But he is fighting France as well as you.\r\n16 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: The way I see it you have a chance at Greece, Tunis or Naples, and Bubapest next turn.\r\n17 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: As for Warsaw you need to talk to him about that.\r\n18 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: Time is running out for this turn.\r\n19 TURKEY -> ENGLAND: I've looked at his previous games, and he does not seem to be trustworthy. I would be wary of him if I were you.\r\n20 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: We have found some common ground and he didn't need to do anything for me this game but he did.\r\n21 TURKEY -> ENGLAND: How exactly is he helping you? Norwegian to Edinburgh? ~N~ It's good for you, that's true. ~N~ Like i said, if he guarantees me the win, I'll do it, but it has to be from him.\r\n22 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: Ok, that's fair enough.\r\n23 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: Wait to hear from him hopefully this turn but maybe the next.\r\n24 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: He is in agreement to the alliance. Could you take Budapest instead of Warsaw, as it would be a gain for our side.\r\n25 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: How about Budapest?\r\n26 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: And he told me he is good with you winning.\r\n27 TURKEY -> ENGLAND: he didn't tell me that.\r\n28 TURKEY -> ENGLAND: France is not attacking him at the moment, it is wholly bent on you. In his move on France, he is simply breaking his former alliance in an opportunistic manner\r\n29 TURKEY -> ENGLAND: there is nothing to say that he won't to the same to me.\r\n30 TURKEY -> ENGLAND: Besides, I like games where Austria survives, though they are rare. ~N~ Perhaps allying with Germany is a good move for you, but it is not a good one for me.\r\n",

I hope to have it to you in an hour or so.\r\n4 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I think you're being fairly reasonable, but you may have overlooked Burgundy; nonetheless, I respect your concern. I'm sure Russia and France would love to use you; you're in a commanding position against France and Russia doesn't have anything to lose, but he's upset I took Norway. I suppose it's unfortunate he Nmrd.\n\nYou have the opportunity to grab Denmark, Holland, or Belgium, or even Norway if you can get Russia's help. I trust you, but I know it must be tempting. I'm willing to work around this in a way that is profitable to both of us.\n\nKiel at the moment can protect Holland and Denmark. I have to think long-term, where I can expand, and what the end-game will look like. I've already explained why I won't assault England; I'd leave myself wide open for Austria and Italy, and even Russia and France. I would have preferred Italy to have built a fleet against France instead of that stupid army against me, and I wish I had built an army instead. Again, sorry. Let's look forward.\n\nI'm pretty sure that Russia's going to support himself into Norway. I know you're nervous about me taking NTH; but if I wanted to, wouldn't I have done it already?\n\nI'd like to make a plan that guarantees you at least one SC by the end of the year--even if it's one of mine--and also keeps us on solid footing against France and Russia. Would you like to draft a plan like that?\r\n5 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I'll only consider a plan with you if you guarantee only 2 fleets bordering the North Sea. Keeping a fleet in Kiel is not a threat to me, and I understand how comforting it can be to Germany... but 4 fleets is a bit overkill.\r\n6 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: That's perfect for me. Here's my proposal:\n\nSwe to Fin. Norway hold. Ska to Swe. Kiel & Belgium bounce in Holland. Wal & Lon S NTH to ENG.\n\nThis leaves only Norway and Belgium bordering NTH, puts you on the offensive against France, and allows you to protect all your home centers. If you can commit to leaving NTH empty, I can commit to pulling my fleets away.\n\nIf you like this plan, I will enter my orders.\r\n7 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Clever. I offered the 2 border fleets as a first step to dmz north sea. I'd rather not give you the option of a juicy retreat. How about nths support hold norway, and london takes EC with wales and belgium support?\r\n8 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Clever. I offered the 2 border fleets as a first step to dmz north sea. I'd rather not give you the option of a juicy retreat. How about nths support hold norway, and london takes EC with wales and belgium support?\r\n9 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: That would be fine too.\r\n10 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: France is likely to cut Belgium's support, though. Not really a big deal, just something to keep in mind.\r\n11 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I'm going to enter my moves as described.\r\n12 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: kk\r\n13 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I'm going to hold norway, and position to cover EDI. I will attack France when you're in a less aggressive stance against me.\r\n",

If you want to work with me, I have a couple ideas.\n\nIdea one: you can honor the Western Triple and position against Russia in the north and I can help you take St. Pete. You can build an army that I can help convoy to the mainland so you can expand to the south with my support. I can keep my end of the deal and support France against foes in the south.\n\nIdea two, we can play along with the Western Triple idea so that France feels safe vacating ENG, and then you can take it. I can handle Russia in the north, and help you into French centers. This would get you centers more quickly than idea one.\n\nI'm very open minded and would love to hear what you think.\r\n3 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: If you want me against Russia, I'll need norway for convoying and other logical reasons. I really could give a rats ass about France getting hit from the south. If you don't remember, you and I both were urging Italy to fight France. You urged me to take the channel against France. France was the target. You pulled out of Burgundy without letting me know. Really, You're one of the worst allies I've ever played with. I really can't trust any direction you're giving me. I'm very flexible, and I want to hold my end of the bargain with you, but you keep changing like the wind. I know that changing strategies is part of the game -- we all do at this high level of play, but you're being a bit excessive -- especially since you're changing all the time and leaving me holding the bag.\n\nYou also wrong in Spring that I'm going to get a build this turn if I work with you. Where is that? I'm thinking it should be Norway. I'm borderline to work with Russia and Austria since they seem to be more reasonable and steady. France was begging to support me to Belgium last turn and I refused because I really value our relationship. However, you backed from Burgundy without letting me know. You built a fleet without letting me know and led me on. etc etc etc.\n\nA western triple doesn't appeal to me. I'm not going to invest myself far from home when you have fleet support at my throat. And you asking me to thin myself more than I am able is a bit much to ask.\n\nSo, if you really want me to be a legitamate ally, I'm asking that you invest in me, and prove that you actually need me to guard your flanks.\r\n4 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: OK, so would you rather position against France or would you prefer to set up to take Norway? I agree, you will need Norway to convoy if you're going to attack Russia. I'm open to both options. I just want to know which one you want to do. Between the three of us, France could fall very quickly.\r\n5 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: We can do both. You are already positioned against russia. Add a fleet of mine and norway to compliment an army convoy. France, I agree, will fall fast with my remaining units, your land support, and italy at the south. All we need to do is lean.\r\n6 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: OK, what moves do you propose?\r\n7 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: If you can convoy sweden to livonia with support and give me norway, then he cannot cover stp, warsaw, and moscow at the same time. It's impossible. You can cover berlin via munich. Ruhr can attempt burgundy without a hitch, assuming you and France are on good terms. Basically, you have 2 fleets in scandinavia that aren't very useful. I'd like to exchange one of your fleets for an army to place in stp and allow extended pressure on Russia. And support from LON to EC.\r\n8 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: You're right, I'm not really using the extra fleet in the north anyway. I like your plan; I'll convoy Sweden to Livonia and support NTH into Norway with Ska--right? Norway could move to NWG or to BAR; which do you prefer? Belgium supports Lon to ENG and York moves to NTH for the convoy. All sound right? Because it sounds smart to me.\r\n9 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: move to norwegian. if all else fails we can always force the barents to disband in the spring\r\n10 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: OK, my moves are set. Keep in touch.\r\n11 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: same - see ya in the morning. Night.\r\n12 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Goodnight.\r\n",

Which is strange, and means I've had to adjust my strategy to compensate. Seems quite stupid for Russia to turn on me though. He has much better options going into Turkey, with more Scs available than what I have... ~N~ ~N~ Hmm, I have to think on this some more.\r\n6 FRANCE -> ITALY: Not at all, I would be the next one facing the juggernaut, and it would have grown too strong for me to stop by then.\r\n7 ITALY -> FRANCE: Thinking about it from a new angle... Russia is going to stab me, so I need to stab him first. I've sent my first idea over to Germany, though I don't know if he'll go for it.\r\n8 FRANCE -> ITALY: I think you might face a combined Turko-russian offensive, considering the fleets Turkey built.. I don't think you stand much chance..but you can slow it down to the point where we can finish England and come to your aid very quickly. ~N~ ~N~ For example, order Ion-aeg and clash him out, etc. Move Naples to Apu.\r\n9 FRANCE -> ITALY: I think your best chances are in persuading Turkey to ally with you - Con-bs and Ankara-armenia will be very effective. He should see your logic that unless you work together, Russia wins.\r\n10 ITALY -> FRANCE: I was actually going to take Vienna, send Venice into Trieste and send Naples to Albania. If it works it would increase my influence in Austria threefold and leave me in position to launch an offensive against Russia.\r\n11 FRANCE -> ITALY: Trieste will be attacked with two support if you are at war.\r\n12 ITALY -> FRANCE: I'm supporting Venice into Trieste so it should bounce, since Vienna will be unprotected.\r\n13 ITALY -> FRANCE: If the convoy over to Albania works then I'll have enough of a force to keep them occupied while I build more fleets to cope with Turkey.\r\n14 FRANCE -> ITALY: If you choose to convoy to Alb, you will lose ION next turn unless you definitely get to build a fleet, at which point it will be a tradeoff between Trieste and ION.

I'd hope for BER and MUN for you.\r\n2 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Mmm, I saw that one coming. Germany's still impossible to talk to. Hopefully he backs off of us a little somehow.\r\n3 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Thank you, thank you. I want you to gain Berlin! Hoping that it all works to plan ;)\r\n4 RUSSIA -> ITALY: errrr... one comma is missing in my message, in the last sentence, before 'and' ;-)\r\n5 ITALY -> RUSSIA: You're such a perfectionist, good god. I hope you're not shrivelling when you look at my midnight rants, hahaha.\nThe outlook on the Southern fleet front is looking sunny! England, funnily enough, reached out to me and congratulated me on my continued existence. It might be a sign of some sort.\r\n6 ITALY -> RUSSIA: (By that, I mean, he may be looking for something from me and/or Turkey. But I won't and haven't thought about stabbing you, my lovely purple friend. It'll just be an interesting development that I hope that our T-R-I alliance may be able to exploit.)\r\n7 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Woof, Germany is quite salty. Claims that he'll just let someone else take over.\r\n8 RUSSIA -> ITALY: When you're at gunpoint, you also LET them take your wallet.\r\n9 RUSSIA -> ITALY: KIE is lost, so Germany won't bother moving BER. But he may want to try to save MUN. In that case, BOH or SIL would be allocated back to MUN. I'm thinking then of attacking BOH from GAL. Would you support from VIE? I know it is risky considering that VIE still is technically under siege.\r\n10 ITALY -> RUSSIA: I'm trying to propose to Germany to move Tyrolia back to Munich. Unsure if he's going to do it/play any longer.\n\nSimultaneously, yes, very willing to support GAL into BOH. If Germany doesn't quit this round, he might in the next, haha.\r\n11 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Are you at all concerned about England going for and obtaining the solo?\r\n12 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Good question. Much depends how reasonable France is. This can be tested after this turn. If I were France, I would be using diplomatic channels like crazy now to make things straight with Italy and Turkey, so that I could shift the fleets back home. Those two builds from the German centres are already heading towards BRE.\r\n13 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Mm. That's true. I haven't been able to figure out if France is in on the stab. Surely not given the danger that it puts him in with his units tied in the South...\nI am uncertain whether he'd contact me given that the last time was to give me a bold-faced and pointless lie, and I expressed disappointment in it.\n\nDo you think you would want to work with Germany/a new Germany (if the present one runs away)? Curious given that I am a bit worried about England's likely exponential growth. Re-grabbing Stp would be nice for you. And it's only a matter of time before Germany gets the boom in Sweden & I suspect NS is headed for SKA.\r\n14 ITALY -> RUSSIA: &boot not boom, sorry\r\n15 RUSSIA -> ITALY: I don't understand Germany's attitude. He's been warned several times about risks of playing with fire. I only received ironic replies. And now he just simply wants to quit? I thought we had here quite experienced players who rage-quitting had behind them.\r\n16 ITALY -> RUSSIA: He's the one none of us expected to join, I believe. I figured it out following the stab on Austria. Regrets don't tend to have a place when it comes to stabs, but this one takes me there.\n\nGermany's whining about England being stupid, and how he was aiming for a 4-way draw with the Western Triple & me, which I'm baffled by given the state of the board. It seems like he truly believed in that narrative, and it's impossible to tell what E & F have said to him. Very frustrating for him to have played into their hand, although well-deserved. The rage-quitting is infuriating and as Austria says, contrary to good etiquette.\r\n17 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Germany will help you kick him ouut of Stp.\n\nFrance makes little contact other than to confirm that we're right to presume he didn't encourage such a stab.\r\n18 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Germany is lying once again. He offered support into STP, but for LVN. I take it as a childish way to talk me into letting him enter PRU.\r\n19 RUSSIA -> ITALY: France is as dumb as Germany:\n\nMe: I hope you realise that those two builds from the German centres are already sailing towards BRE.\nFrance: I respect your hustle.\r\n20 RUSSIA -> ITALY: So basically it's you, Turkey, and myself against England with his solo ambitions.\r\n21 RUSSIA -> ITALY: I forgot to confirm with you the move GAL -> BOH. Will VIE support?\r\n22 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Why. Just why. Why does he want LVN. He told me straight up he will at least get you Stp back, and I figured that he gave up on the game but wouldn't mind a few kicks at England.\n\nThis is what France said, following my mention that it looks like England's stab on Germany is one intended for France too:\nYou have correctly diagnosed the situation. Rest assured, I am not foolish enough to have encouraged England's stab.\n\nI took the \"rest assured\" in a positive way but not so sure anymore. Annoying that F-G would prefer doubling down on us over self-preservation.\r\n23 ITALY -> RUSSIA: And yes. I've locked in everything/readied.\nVienna support moves to Bohemia from Galicia.\r\n24 RUSSIA -> ITALY: France apparently doesn't look ahead, only reacts to current situation.\r\n25 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Germany had just sent me a message saying that FIN can't support MOS. Speechless... He asked me previously if I'd be interested in getting STP back, and that he could support LVN in with the simultaneous tap of NWY from SWE. I told him I would be interested if he supported MOS instead. I was stupid enough not to be fully explicit that it is about MOVE support not HOLD.\r\n26 RUSSIA -> ITALY: With just 30 mins on the clock, and with a noob like that, I'm indecisive as to what orders to give in the north. Noob or liar.\r\n27 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Maybe he really submitted move support for MOS? Maybe he has changed the order for LVN? Or maybe he is lying, and simply wants to get into PRU? Ally or foe, noob or liar?\nQuestions, questions, questions...\r\n28 RUSSIA -> ITALY: I think I'll just take the risk, and send LVN into STP supported by MOS.\r\n29 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Germany messaged to me that England has... somehow \"blocked\" him from messaging. I'm unsure if that's even possible in the game.\n\nThat's messed up. I don't think he's lied to me before, however, he is very stubborn. I messaged to tell him to move support for Moscow but god knows. He always does this. Noob wildcard is my final opinion on it, haha.\n\nHmm, that's not the bad idea... I'm concerned because in the move after that, Sweden won't be of any help and England will just dominate the [473182].\r\n30 RUSSIA -> ITALY: You can mute a player so that they're unable to send you messages. Never mute anyone, you may need them at some point in the future.\r\n31 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Ahh, I see, I see. That doesn't seem wise, yes. England is confident that he'll be able to take down Germany, then.\n\nNo response from G. He hasn't even confirmed he'll be moving Tyrolia back to Munich.\r\n",

The Russian will work with me against Turkey, or so he says.\n\nThe north is a bit grey. The German adamantly insists he's 100% with us in a middle powers alliance to end this game with a three-way draw. I told he that the two of us would need to catch up with him in centers since he is obviously huge and a threat. He agreed to that and to an ultimate center distribution of him only adding Stp and the three English centers to his current total. I'm still not sure what to make of all that, so I'll be working with the Russian and trying to stay as neutral as possible with Germany to allow for that three-way middle powers draw that is ever so tempting...\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the north?\r\n3 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: No thoughts?!\n\nI have a few things figured out in the north, finally!! The Russian wants Warsaw to support Galicia to Silesia, which will happen. The German will send Sil to Pru and Mun to Sil, so Mun will remain in Mun. If you take Ven to Tyrolia and Tus to Pie, we will guarantee keeping Germany out of Tyrolia and allow you to put pressure on France by being in Pie, along with Ion taking Tyrr and East Med taking Ion. Aeg will support hold at Smy while Rum and Greece support Serb to Bul. How does all that sound?\r\n4 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: PS - Your lack of communication has me a little worried... I'm 100% confident that Munich will not attck Tyrolia. Would you be willing to bounce Venice with Budapest in Trieste this spring and take Tyrolia in the autumn, it would give me some peace of mind? This middle powers alliance is for real and we can take the game with it, have a three way draw, all we have to do is stick together... as long as we pressure the German to help us grow while he remains the same size... Plus, we can always move against him and claim it is only to get our centers evened out... Talk to me, I need your input as I trust you more than anyone in here, the A/I alliance is first and foremost, but the A/I/G would virtually guarantee us a three-way draw!!\r\n5 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I love you too, Austria. I've just been in the middle of a lot of non-diplomacy related activity- you know, completely irrelevant shit.\n\nSo you do trust Germany, then? It's always possible he's for real... If he is though, I dunno how that move on Sil's going to go over. We should either hit him full on, or not at all, I think. While we decide on that, though, I say definitely move Bud to Vie instead of the bounce in Tri. It's a little safer, I think. Unless you're worried about Russia slippting into Bud.\nAlso, If Germany moves on Boh and Tyr, he'd have shot at Vie and Tri, you might want to take Bul with Greece just so Serb can stay behind to defend.\nLet me know your thoughts on that. The biggest issue here is our decision on Germany, because if we DON'T attack him, Russia's going to have to attack SOMEONE. It's either going to be Germany or you. So bear that in mind.\nLet me know your thoughts.\r\n6 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I'm doing my best to keep our options open. The German built a fleet in Kiel at my request, I wasn't overly excited about him building an army that could easily head our way. Everyone is alarmed by the German's size, something the German understands, so if something goes wrong with him, we will have more than enough help taking him down. I think Tus to Pie, Ion to Tyrr and East Med to Ion are pretty much locked in, correct? If so, the Frenchman won't like that too much, even if you have a solid argument as to why you do that. Anyway, I am working in the east with the Russian this season and will re-evaluate in the autumn, but I'm confident the German is with us. He's got his hands SERIOUSLY full with E/F, which will provide us the leverage we need. If the German is bluffing and allied with France, you will be ready and I will be in good standing with the Russian after spring moves, at that point it will be real decision time, I think.\n\nPS - I have not told the German I am getting supported into Sil, but have told him to give me a little freedom to maneauver this spring and by the end of the year he will see I'm for real, so it won't be a problem, please trust me on that point.\n\nPPS - I'm not worried about Rum attacking Bud, but I'd like to stay in Bud to keep Rum from attacking Bud this autumn, so I'd like the bounce with you in Trieste, please confirm if this will work for you.\n\nPPPS - If you are not nervous about the Frenchman blitzing Tunis with two units, we could also have East Med support hold at Smy and have Smy support Aeg to Con, in case Ank supports Con to Smy?\r\n7 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: [605994], my computer froze and erased my entire book-length response.\nSo, quickly, I trust you know what you're doing with the North. If Germany is for real, then we're in great shape as a team. If not, you're right, lots of ppl are itching to take him down.\nSo, I am going to send both fleets East. Not just to protect myself, but because if we are blitzing the French I'm going to want them for offense as well. I'd like support hold in Smyr this turn, but I'm pretty sure you can take Con in the fall, anyway. Esp with a Russian hit to break support in Black.\nI'll move into Pie, and I'll bounce you in Tri. Sound good?\nAlso, England is probably working with Germany, no? Russia will have trouble in St Pete real soon if so.\r\n8 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: All sounds great, thanks! I'm not sure if England is with Germany or not, but shouldn't be a problem either way.\r\n9 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Hey, if people ask about our bounce in Tri, let's not tell them it was planned, let's at least be vague about it, what do you think? Maybe it will be too obvious with Aeg supporting hold at Smy, but if people ask, I guess maybe it won't be obvious...\r\n10 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: PS - We are getting very close to taking control of this game, by the end of the year we should be fully on track with the German and the middle powers alliance, I'm getting excited already!! :-)\r\n11 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Agreed. Let's make them wonder. That's just a little bit less brainpower dedicated to guess our next move.\r\n12 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: And let's keep our own radar on max for this year. We'll have to decide between Russia and Germany really soon.\r\n13 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Will do.\r\n14 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I'm sowing the seeds, too. Telling France I'm thinking of going for Tri.\r\n15 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Great, I told Russia I plan to cover Trieste to insure you don't \"try something stupid\"... Great minds think alike!\r\n",

I can confirm talking to France trying to make him stab Germany without getting any response. On the contrary Germany says he's willing to stop fighting me and go vs France but we can't know if that's true.\nSo Italy suggests that we let him be and that we ally vs Germany and France.\nHis initial message mentioned that I ally with him vs Germany while I attack you.\nI told him there is no way I will have 2 enemies (G and you) just to ally with him and that it will be a triple alliance I/R/T only if you agree.\nSo, you are going to decide about it.\nDo you want us to keep pressuring Italy or that we ally with him against F/G?\nAt this point there are two steady alliances in the game, F/G and us the juggernaut. Italy is trying to fit in somewhere...\nWhatever you decide, I'm in!\nLet's decide about this first and then moves of the turn\r\n1 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: well, i can live with italy being our temporary ally, but then he will have to let me get a piece of france or something, otherwise i can't grow except for serbia. unless you let me into the germany front through galicia. but that would be slow. i don't want us to take out italy and then have to draw with germany and france, but i don't want us to ally with italy and then have a five way draw either....\r\n2 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: ok then we can just exploit Italy, have him fight France while I attack Germany full power and you take Serbia.\nThen 1-3 years from now we can still attack Italy.\nI will let you know of a plan proposal tomorrow.\nI'm off to bed now!\r\n3 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: ok, i've talked with italy and i told him that i have no problem with him being in our alliance, but he would somehow have to find a way for me to get a piece of france if we do get that far. and where should i move my fleet in constantinople to?\r\n4 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: ok. good night.\r\n5 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: Italy should move adr-apu so that you move aeg-ion and con-aeg\r\n6 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: cu tomorrow\r\n7 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: ok.\r\n8 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I also talked to Italy if he's alright with our proposal and responded with\n\"We shall see\"\nNot a great response right?\nSo I say let's not count on Italy.\nHis existence depends solely on us. He knows that, yet he decided to respond arrogantly.\nSo here is my plan proposal for this turn:\ngre-serb with rum and bul support\nsmy convoy to gre\ncon-smy\nI know that leaves your fleets stuck but this way we get a new Turkish army in the balkans to further pressure Italy next turn\nalso, bud-tri (cut support +protection in case tri-bud)\nboh-vie with gal support (playing it safe, the opposite might be cut from Germany)\nsev s rum hold (no reason)\nand mos-war (to attack Germany next year)\nat north I will either try to cover nor or hit edi or hit london\nI haven't decided yet\nWhat do you think?\r\n9 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: it's possible that Italy will have vie-bud with tri support\nin that case I get vie and he gets bud\nI don't see anything we can about that risk\nthe only way to protect bud would be rum s bud and bud/gal s boh-vie\nbut you need rum to support gre-ser cause if tri supports ser to hold then you wont get it with just bul support\nso priority 1 is getting vie and ser and priority 2 protecting bud in my plan\r\n10 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: & on second thought I think i need to move mos back to stp\nsituation really unpredictable at north\nif Italy asks you pretend we are ok with him and that you are just going for ser while I mvoe against Germany\r\n11 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: hey have you seen my messages?\n[1383069] left!\r\n12 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I m not going to change orders\nlet's hope you see my messages in time\nI'm finalizing now!\r\n",

Or did he come up with this terrible idea by himself?\r\n1 FRANCE -> TURKEY: If this was achieved through diplomacy, I tip my hat to you.\r\n2 TURKEY -> FRANCE: I wish I could take credit for it, but I can't. I think England saw his opening and went for it.\r\n3 FRANCE -> TURKEY: You have a similar opening against Russia currently. But you and I both understand why you haven't taken advantage of it. England apparently does not.\r\n4 TURKEY -> FRANCE: This is true. I have more to lose than I have to gain by dotting Russia right now.\r\n5 FRANCE -> TURKEY: England's stab is likely to destabilize the board. So, we're at a point where it makes sense to reconsider past plans and see if they are still working.\n\nYou and I have been in opposite camps so far. But it does not necessarily have to stay that way. England's betrayal forces me to realign my troops in a way that is not so focused on the Mediterranean. Of course, you could remain allied with Russia/Italy. If you did, you could almost certainly wipe me out and claim a three way draw.\n\nBut if you want a chance to solo, you have a moment here to try to break out. Since there is no longer a western triple on the board, you are not as dependent on Italy and Russia. You could potentially claim Naples, Rumania, and Budapest in this next round.\n\nObviously in the long term, I would try to stop you from soloing. But in the middle term, I think all out chaos is better for me than the Russia/Turkey/Italy alliance. But I genuinely think that your best chance to break out is right now while things are scrambled.\r\n6 TURKEY -> FRANCE: I agree that the England's stab shakes up the board considerably. I'm definitely not opposed to working with you not that I don't have to worry about a powerful WT. Most of the time, I'm a strong alliance player, but of course when the opportunity to solo presents itself I'll gladly go for it. I've obviously had the opportunity to stab Italy but haven't taken it.\n\nIt appears to me though, that England is stabbing Germany, but not touching you. You two have had a strong alliance from the beginning. So even if I do make some gains for myself by taking on Italy and/or Russia, I still have to face a strong alliance in the north and west. Is that right?\r\n7 FRANCE -> TURKEY: My back is exposed to England and he has muted me.\n\nI think I have to expect an attack.\r\n8 FRANCE -> TURKEY: So, I expect your fleets to have more room to operate soon. I could leave one or two fleets behind to assist with Italy though.\r\n9 TURKEY -> FRANCE: Why would he mute you? Seems if he were going to stab you he wouldn't want you to see it coming\r\n10 FRANCE -> TURKEY: You'd have to ask England. He muted me and Germany earlier today. Maybe he didn't want to hear me trying to convince him to withdraw from German provinces (because let me tell you, I was trying).\r\n11 FRANCE -> TURKEY: But, I do not feel like I was rude or crossed any lines, which is what I usually reserve the mute button for.\r\n12 FRANCE -> TURKEY: By telling you there is no hope for the Western Triple, I am perhaps giving you more information than I should. You could of course share it with your allies. Or you could be a step ahead of them.\r\n13 TURKEY -> FRANCE: I appreciate you sharing that with me. I have no need to go blabbing about it to my neighbors. If it is indeed true, they will see it soon enough for themselves.\r\n",

I'm guessing that you don't trust me very much.\r\n1 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: It was an offer of peace to Turkey to try and get him to build fleets to go after Italy. But he doesn't seem interested in that.\n\nAnd I don't really trust you when it comes down to it, And I fully expect you to take my centers. But I'd rather see you take them than Turkey. So I'll be moving St. P > Mos.\r\n2 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: I'm not moving on Norway. I'm taking London this season.\n\nSecondly, I've got Italy giving me propositions on turning on France. I have decided to stab France and keep you as an ally into the end game because we control the stalemate line while France has given that up. This will have further benefits when Turkey has no place to go after building to his maximum and not being able to take St Pete or crossing the stalemate line and will give him greater reason to turn on Italy.\n\nIt may or may not work, and if it doesn't then I'm not out anything. I have already secured my portion of the draw and have decided that I want you to be a part of it. We have worked well together, and as I stated earlier, it went a long way with me when you a) didn't jump on the bandwagon and attack me in 1901/02 and b) gave me Sweden as a build.\n\nHere's what I do ask, however: If you are going to move to Moscow with your army, then I ask that you move to St Pete with your fleet. I've got an order in to get my fleet into Prussia and after that, there will only be 1 hole left in the stalemate line at Livonia which gives you a place to retreat to. I will help you maintain control of St Pete and Norway so that you can control these two pieces of the line. The remainder of my free units will move on France to reduce this draw to a 4-way and I will call the game to a halt.\n\nSound alright with you? You have my word that I will stick by this.\r\n3 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: Here's another idea that's faster: I know it puts a lot of trust in me, but I promise that you won't regret it. It would be faster for you to move Norway to the Barents sea and keep St Pete where it is. My fleet at Sweden will move south into the Gulf of Bothnia and on to Livonia. This would seal up the stalemate line this year and free up two of my units to reduce France. Hope you read the first part of this message. Let me know asap.\r\n4 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: Well I'm confused as to what you're talking about. There's the Mun/Sil/War/Ukr/Mos stalemate as well. Are we going to try to set that one up? I don't see any reason not to.\n\nIf you actually stay true to your word (Which, to be honest, I don't actually expect) I'll be very grateful indeed. But I'm somewhat confused as to your plan.\n\nWhat's wrong with:\n\nNor > Stp\nStp > Mos\nWar SH Ukr\nUrk Support Stp > Mos\r\n5 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: There's nothing wrong with that. I hadn't thought about the War/Ukr/Mos line. Instead of moving my fleets to Lvn, Pru, I can simply turn about face and move on the Island.\n\nSilesia will support holds on Warsaw and I'll change my orders now.\r\n6 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: We need one more unit in Ber or Pru to support the hold of Sil.\n\nIf you want, my fleet in Norway can sail with yours and help you take England/kill France. Or I could take Edi, gegt a build in St. P and move it to Pru to SH Sil like we need.\r\n7 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: (And of course, you need a unit in Kie/Ruh to support hold Munich. But that's not likely to be a problem.\r\n8 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: thats fine. Our fleets working in conjunction would do nicely. I have the one moving to denmark and the other moving to the channel. If i get into the channel successfully then you can take london for the fast build.\r\n9 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: Well I was thinking I'd just move to Norwegian. It's just as quick a route to MAO, and it's guaranteed.\r\n10 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: Plus, we need to get fleets there quickly or Italy will break through. Very quickly.\r\n11 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: Sounds great!\r\n",

Too bad Turkey didn't take Sevastopol when he had the chance.\nHow would you like to proceed in the Mediterranean?\r\n1 ITALY -> FRANCE: I'll support Tyrr to Ionian with Tunis, you move Western to Tyrr?\r\n2 FRANCE -> ITALY: order is in.\r\n3 FRANCE -> ITALY: I'd take Trieste with Venice supported by Tyrolia were I you. This way you can build in Venice and have a nice strong triangle poised to take more in 1905. I wish England had taken BEL.\n\nCan we get Turkey working with us, at least briefly?\r\n4 FRANCE -> ITALY: I think maybe I've changed my mind. If you take Vienna with Tyrolia and move Venice to Tyrolia, you would have the same triangle after a build in Venice and an easy take of Trieste, especially if Serbia covers Trieste. It would put Turkey in a stronger defensive position. You'll be in the Ionian as well, so you're position will be strong.\n\nAfter we get ourselves in good shape, I should probably withdraw my fleet. You can use it to support TUN into the ION, but I doubt you would feel all that comfortable with a French fleet looking into Rome and Naples!\n\nIf we could establish a DMZ in NAF, WES, GOL, PIE that would be great. I very much appreciate your trust in undertaking this adventure.\r\n5 ITALY -> FRANCE: I've tried talking to him but he hasn't replied. Have you had any luck?\n\nAs for my moves that's what I'd got planned!\r\n6 FRANCE -> ITALY: Turkey replied and indicated willingness to help. I suggested that he coordinate with you.\r\n7 ITALY -> FRANCE: OK, when was this? Just so I can track whether it was before or after my last message. If the latter I'll message him again.\r\n8 FRANCE -> ITALY: 16:06 GMT\r\n9 ITALY -> FRANCE: Cheers, that was after. He's messaged me in the meantime anyway.\r\n",

I'll take livonia, I think, and that means that you'll have to go back to St,.

I would have gone for Marseilles a long time ago if I were him.\r\n26 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: I was planning on hitting Sweden as is. I hope he stays in the south.\r\n27 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: I think Germany may hit me in Belgium from Holland and North Sea.\r\n28 TURKEY -> ENGLAND: I told Austria I was supporting him into Naples, but he wanted to take Rome. Piedmont to Mar would have been great, you're right. ~N~ But it's not like he has anywhere to build this turn anyway.\r\n29 TURKEY -> ENGLAND: Yes, the bel move is a possibility, but why would he support you there in the first place? I don't know what he's thinking, if he could take it for himself. Talk to him.\r\n30 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: I think he is worried about France. If my Fleet is gone France's Armies will move east. I got him all worked up about it till he helped me.\r\n31 TURKEY -> ENGLAND: so you talked to him?\r\n32 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: More like played mind games with him. :-)\r\n33 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: And I hope this breaks up their alliance.\r\n34 TURKEY -> ENGLAND: Very nice.\r\n35 TURKEY -> ENGLAND: me too\r\n36 TURKEY -> ENGLAND: You know, we're beating them SC wise.\r\n37 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: HA HA HA. France and Germany hitting each other that will be great.\r\n38 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: Yes we have more power.\r\n39 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: Austria should have hit Naples, Why didn't he?\r\n40 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: I guess Austria can't build his 6th unit this turn.

I think Turkey will poke Rum, so maybe I should move gre-serb for a bounce? I'm not sure. What do you think Turkey will do?

I believe that you can delay France's conquest of England slightly with a move to West Med or Piedmont - both might be too aggressive.\r\n5 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: G says Gal is up to me to move. How should I move it?\r\n6 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: hmm hard question...i think that they will attack Gal and Serbia...lets stick to the previous plan, for the moment Tunis to Ionian, Eastern to Smyrna supported by Aegean, Serbia to Bul supported by Greece and gal and trieste will bounce in Vienna...i will move also Ven to Tyr (just in case)...and i will reserve my army in apulia for a future convoy...\n\nwe can also move trieste to vienna supported by gal, and ven to trieste so in autumn i can attack Bud...\n\nwhat do you think?\n\ni will connect again tomorrow morning :)\r\n7 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Yeah those were the original two options.

The Gre and East Med moves for sure, but in Vie/Tri I am not sure.\n\nAny insights to what Russia might do?\r\n8 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: me neither...i'm still thinking about the Vie/Tri moves...for the moment no idea about russia..from my point of view he is allied with turkey and they are playing a role (but who knows)...more tomorrow\r\n9 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Turkey seemed really desperate in his messages to me but you could be right.\r\n10 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: hmm then we can play with that...for the moment i'm moving Ven to Tyr, Tunis to Ionian, Serbia to Bulgaria (i hope that supported by greece) and aegean will support eastern to Smyrna...i will connect one or two hours before the turn ends...any other thing, please tell me...\r\n11 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: hmm germany wants me to move against france right now...i can move my fleet and my army (that will give at least one build more that can help us)...and also with that i will secure german help in the east...if i do that, i can move apulia to ven so in autumn i can support trieste (if needed) or move to tyr....\n\nwhat do you think?\r\n12 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I think that is a good idea, although, germany hasn't confirmed with me the bounce in Vienna. So he is talking to you and not me which i disconcerting. I say go ahead and move against France, but talk to England before you do. he will likely be a better ally than the german.\r\n13 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: and i have your support to bul and a move to smy entered.\r\n14 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: great! lets see what happen in Smyrna and with Serbia!!\n\nFrance will get a very big surprise :)\r\n",

        "intent_dialogue": "0 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Okay so you support me to Bud this turn or in Autumn? Bud in Spring followed by your taking Serb in Autumn.\r\n1 RUSSIA -> ITALY: I'll think about this some more.\nTurkey says he wants to work with me. It is best if he thinks that I will. But if I can gain a build this year, we will be in a good position to tighten the noose. I hope that is okay with you?\r\n2 ITALY -> RUSSIA: I am not sure if I will support you into GAL in the Spring to be honest. I am a little worried about the fact that Turkey seemed to just give RUM away and that he also just kept BLA stationary, that coupled with your stab on Germany makes things all seem a bit fishy to me, what am I to do if I support you in Spring and then you support the Turk in Autumn?\n\nI am committed to being a good ally to you, but I must also be a bit cautious too.\r\n3 RUSSIA -> ITALY: I was just about to message you\r\n4 RUSSIA -> ITALY: I understand the caution. I was amazed by Turkey's move moves last turn.\nAnd yes, apparently he wants to ally with me.\nI guess fro his perspective it makes sense.\nBut can you see from my perspective how much more profitable it would be for me to work with you.\r\n5 RUSSIA -> ITALY: From Turkeys point of view, he could ally with you against me. But where is he going to go? It is not as if I am wide open. I have quite a number of southern units. Plus you have grown into a strong power, so it is is going to be hard going towards the west... Unless he has a Russian ally.\r\n6 RUSSIA -> ITALY: But consider my perspective... You are a much safer prospect. You have less incentive and fewer opportunities to stab me. And I you.\nIf we can remove Turkey from the corner, wow! the whole board opens up to us.\nNo need to guard the rear.\r\n7 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Germany was probably a mistake. But if by some stroke of fortune both England and France attack Germnay, then it will have been the right decision. Germany and I could not be allies. There was no room for either both of us. More likely he would carve up England with France, and then France would turn on you, while Germany attacked me.\nMy supporting England was intended to delay the inevitable, or to weaken the inevitable. With all the English Scs, Germany would have some serious firepower. Too much for France to risk taking him on, which means France would have to attack you.\r\n8 RUSSIA -> ITALY: So please believe I am on your side. Surely you can see how it makes sense?\r\n9 RUSSIA -> ITALY: I have been trying to ally with you since Spring 1901. I supported you into Vienna, much to Turkey's annoyance.\r\n10 RUSSIA -> ITALY: If you can't support me in Spring I understand and it might not be the end of the world, but it would be much better if you could.\r\n11 RUSSIA -> ITALY: If Turkey thinks I will ally with him, that is a good thing for both you and me. So it might not be for the best for you to do too good a job of convincing him to attack me (something Turkey says you have been doing every turn since the start of the game. I understand why you would do this, as naturally early on you would rather see Turkey attack me than you. But now is different. You cannot avoid conflict with Turkey. And if Turkey thinks there is a chance I will work with him, it makes things just a bit easier for us.)\r\n12 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Anyway we have a little time before phase end. I hope we can talk some more. I really want to win your trust. I really am genuine.\r\n13 ITALY -> RUSSIA: I think had you not attacked Germany the France would have at least grabbed one SC from England and both he and Germany would have stalemated for a few phases. Now I think he is more likely to attack me, but that is another story.\n\nAfter looking at the map I was going to support you to BUD in Autumn, but I would still need to be lucky enough to get into SER myself that way. I will support GAL-BUD this Spring but expect support then to SER in the next phase.\n\nI know that you would be better off with me than going with Turkey, I just hope you know that too. I think you will also find by my actions that I have been mostly hostile towards Turkey in this game. In that one turn we both committed to building armies so that there would still be an even chance between all 3 of our nations, he went back on that deal and has disregarded me ever since.\n\nWhat are you going to do if Germany has armies in both BER and SIL?\r\n14 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Also have you been trying to get Turkey to support you into BUD?\r\n15 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Turkey says he will support me to bud.\nGermany in sil is tricky. I guess I am hoping I will be able to build in war by year end.\r\n16 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Feel free to give me advice . This turn is tough. I am trying to figure out what to with Sev. Do I move the fleet back, and bring an army down to rum?\nOr do I move an army mos-SEV?\r\n17 ITALY -> RUSSIA: If you put an army into RUM then you would need to have it supported, that way the worst than can happen is a bounce, that would mean no moves on BUD in the Spring.\r\n18 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Yes you are probably right. I was counting on the idea the that Turkey won't attack me because he is trying to get me to work with him. But this might be a bit optimistic of me.\r\n19 RUSSIA -> ITALY: So what to do? Do I try for bud with your support or do we wait for Autumn.\r\n20 RUSSIA -> ITALY: My preference would be take Bud this turn. But if you think Autumn is best we'll go with that.\r\n21 ITALY -> RUSSIA: I think generally it would be best to have all your units in position rather than taking BUD. He could easily make a move on RUM, who knows. I just think it would be best.\r\n22 RUSSIA -> ITALY: okay that's is what we will do.\r\n23 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Ultimately its up to you, I have VIE set to support GAL-BUD anyways so you will have to make the choice about which move will bring down Turkey quicker.\r\n24 RUSSIA -> ITALY: oh you have booked that support?\nOkay I think it over. If you really believe waiting is the best thing that does tip me in that direction. I am at work now, so I can't give this any further thought, but I'll check in later. Thanks.\r\n",

I'm traveling now, but I will have time tonight to write. Ttys.\r\n2 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: OK, the Russian hasn't even responded to me. I think we have a good plan: I move Fin to St. Pete with support from Norway while NWG moves to NAO and London supports Belgium to ENG. With that plan you get a build by taking Sweden in the fall (thus the disband in Ska) and I don't lose anything because I've managed to take St. Pete. Also, since I have the army in Prussia, I can more readily support myself south while you use your additional build to get another fleet with which to fight France. Actually, it's fairly simple and I'm confident it will work. If I lose Belgium it'll be because France has compromised Brest and MAO, and in the long run that will be more disastrous for him. In the end you'd be set up against France and Russia. What do you think?\r\n3 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I'm not thrilled about the move to NAO, but I see the potential in the move against France. This sounds like a fair plan.\r\n4 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: OK, my moves are entered. Please support Fin to St. Pete; NWG moves to NAO. Belgium moves to ENG. Thanks!\r\n5 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Hello, and I hope you've had a merry Christmas. While I am still on the road, I'd like to take a moment to reaffirm our alliance. I bet it is tempting to side with France against me, but I am very sincere about our plan. If you have any misgivings, please let me know. I want to make it work, I want you to grow, and I think I've demonstrated my goodwill. Please just let me know if you would prefer to do things differently; I am confident that I have more to offer you than France could.\n\nRegards,\nGermany\r\n6 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Hello again.

I'd rather kill him, and I think it will be easy to do that. You take Edi, I take Liv. Dead by the end of year.\r\n2 FRANCE -> GERMANY: We can't worry with him in our back while we fight England.\r\n3 GERMANY -> FRANCE: he could be useful fighting russia in the north?\r\n4 FRANCE -> GERMANY: Like, I just told you, it is easier to kill him and get the builds. Then we will be able to use the units we would otherwise have to keep in our lands to prevent him from betraying us to fight Russia as well.. ~N~ ~N~ There is no need for an extra chain - it only increases chance of betrayal and makes cooperation harder.\r\n5 GERMANY -> FRANCE: you're not big on two way conversation huh! ~N~ I think Turkey and Russia are allies which is v dangerous...\r\n6 FRANCE -> GERMANY: Yeah, it can be.. ~N~ ~N~ Okay, you take Edi and I take Lvp now? and next year we can get London.. I strongly suggest that Den supports Kiel to Baltic Sea.. and Boh moves to Sil or starts actively helping Italy.. If you want to start the fight against Russia early, I suppose the solution is Boh-sil, Munich-berlin.. I suspect he might order War-sil or War-pru.. so you need to counter these without losing too much ground.. ~N~ ~N~ Do you mind if I come to Bur? I might soon have to support hold in Munich for you.\r\n7 FRANCE -> GERMANY: We are lucky that England did not disband Barents Sea, that should slow Russia down.\r\n8 FRANCE -> GERMANY: Our problem is that there are power voids in your eastern front and through North Sea - once you get Edi.. we must fill these quickly before he becomes Russia does... Baltic Sea is a nice move since if he orders North Sea, it will leave him very vulnerable in Scandinavia as well as helping you against Eastern attacks.\r\n9 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Agree on England in Barents Sea and Russia's moves....I have tried to offer support to Italy and bring him onside but he has not replied...perhaps you could try ~N~ ~N~ If its ok with you then Id prefer it if you didnt move to BUR - we need to establish some trust. I know that if we stab each other now then we are both doomed but still ~N~ ~N~ I will not take EDI this turn....I would prefer to try and take SWE in Autumn. I still think we should keep Eng in the game but I am not going to argue the toss! ~N~ ~N~ Happy days!\r\n10 FRANCE -> GERMANY: Erm, you should definitely take Edi... It is good because it will make England disband more units, which opens the way for me through EC to come to your aid in the seas. Do not make Russia more aggressive against you yet.. ~N~ ~N~ About Bur, I will move in when you ask me to, but I fear it might be too late..\r\n11 GERMANY -> FRANCE: maybe in autumn then....I at least want Russia to consdier me a real threat so he thinks twice about launching full frontal assault!!\r\n12 FRANCE -> GERMANY: You have the wrong mentality.. ~N~ ~N~ If he considers you a serious threat, he will launch an attack sooner rather than finishing Italy and giving us precious time first. ~N~ ~N~ We have to kill England as soon as possible so that my [56129] can get there to counter Russia. You delay it now, you might not be able to take Edi next turn. It is your delaying that put us in this position - please do not continue it.\r\n13 GERMANY -> FRANCE: the problem is that i just dont trust you...if you move out of BEL and we agree to keep HOL/BEL as DMZ that I will agree to your plan\r\n14 FRANCE -> GERMANY: erm, I would be stupid to stab you now.. It would give Russia the game. ~N~ ~N~ I can't leave Bel empty while England is in EC or you or Russia is in NS.\r\n15 FRANCE -> GERMANY: There is no reason not to trust me, the game is quickly turning into Russia vs everyone and it would be stupid to slow ourselves down due to paranoia\r\n16 GERMANY -> FRANCE: \"there is no reason not to trust me\" - you are insulting the little intelligence I have ~N~ I agree that you cannot leave it empty whilst Eng is in the EC...when you knock him out or he moves maybe you will consider it?\r\n17 FRANCE -> GERMANY: yeah, of course I will.\r\n18 FRANCE -> GERMANY: there's really no reason not to trust me - if you were in my position would you stab you? Russia would eat me alive.\r\n19 FRANCE -> GERMANY: Have I convinced you to move to Edi..?\r\n20 GERMANY -> FRANCE: maybe in Autumn\r\n21 FRANCE -> GERMANY: Ok, I disagree but you will be the first one to die if we are too slow, so it's your choice. Can you support Brest-ec then?\r\n22 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Listen, I have no choice but to trust you in the short term....you are absolutely right, if one of us stabs the other in the early stages then its all over for us ~N~ Its the medium term that concerns me ~N~ Bully boy barking isnt going to get you anywhere...Im happy to discuss things rationally if you like and come to my own conclusions whether good or bad. Of course you will come to yours...if they happen to co-incide we'll maybe build some trust ~N~ In the meantime, clearly I am not going to attack you unprovoked in the short term. If you decide to attack me thats fine but I will react by doing my utmost to take you out (yawn yawn...) ~N~ Go for England if you think its a good strategy - personally I dont but I wont defend him. Who am I to question such an experienced and successful player :)\r\n23 FRANCE -> GERMANY: Well, thing is, it won't work unless we act together\r\n24 FRANCE -> GERMANY: So, no support to EC either?\r\n",

Why did [151052] just move out? ~N~ ~N~ How about you support me into Moscow? That way we'll remain even in Scs (as opposed you having 8 to my 6). I already feel a little uncomfortable since I've violated one of my own rules by letting myself be open to a significant stab. ~N~ ~N~ England would be a better partner since it looks like he is getting ready to eat France alive. Although it would be nice to lead France on a little since we don't want him teaming up with Russia to take Munich. ~N~ ~N~ England told me he wasn't working with Italy, I didn't completely believe him though. Maybe he views [151052] as his primary competition in the league and wants to take him out when he gets the chance.\r\n5 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: ok, i will support you into moscow. ~N~ about venice, i feel really bad actually. i agreed not to move there, then with 5 hours to go(before the turn finished) i told [151052] that i had to to stop him moving up to tyrolia and having triest in the fall move as i have no support units nearby. but he didnt sign on again.\r\n6 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: this is my message to england- ~N~ ~N~ i really think we need to say goodbye to russia and italy soon. once they are out of the way turkey can threaten the soft underbelly of france and i can take burg and from their we can get a 3 way draw between us. ~N~ ~N~ so i hope that neither of us will help the small powers from now on, its their time to go im afraid. if we use them than there is a chance, a small chance that tthey might get big again, look at russia, a few years ago he was looking nearly finished but he signed a peace deal with you in the north and turkey was stuck with a fleet in sevas and he could survive and grow a bit. ~N~ ~N~ basically i mean if you dont help russia(in berlin) or italy i wont help france(into kiel)\r\n7 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: i will leave ukraine after i hv supported you into moscow, that way i will not have 2 units next to sevas. ~N~ ~N~ if you like we could set up some open border system soon. i take rumnaia away and you move sevas to moscow and moscow to livonia. ~N~ ~N~ anyway thats next year. lets kill off russia first\r\n8 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: oh, from \" i will leave ukraine....\" onwards that the meesage to you, not to england\r\n9 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: Feel bad about Venice, but don't feel too bad. You did get another SC. ~N~ ~N~ Thanks for the support. The plan for open borders sounds good, obviously we'll have to see what England ends up putting in St. Pete (I assume that It will be a fleet, but you never know). ~N~ ~N~ I will contact England also.\r\n10 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: do you want venice to support ionian into apu? i think [151052] will head back up to try to kick me out of venice now. we(you) must capture naples next year i hope. cons to aegan new fleet built in smyna will give you 4 fleets to his 2(plus england might help him, or maybe not)\r\n11 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: if russia is smart warsaw will attack ukraine, then he will cut my support for the attack on moscow, it wont be showed on the little map, you will need to look at the big map to see the cut support moves.\r\n12 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: we need to kill off italy. you will get st petes this year so as a sign of good faith how about you offer ionian to support west med into tunis?(but naples could attack and cut that support) i will move rumania either to ukr or galica this turn and then if you move sevas to moscow we should feel pretty safe with our border.\r\n13 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: england should help you with tunis , in return i am helping him in the north.. ~N~ ~N~ i guess we have to wait and see what unit italy disbands before making a plan to take down italy. he is small and only has 3 units but he is a master tactician.\r\n14 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: England is going to support me into Tunis this turn and I'll support him into St. Pete next. ~N~ ~N~ Italy may write off Tunis as being a lost cause and try to retake Venice with the other three ~N~ ~N~ Depending on what Russia does I will withdraw Sev to Armenia, and you can then move Rumania (as you mentioned).

I have venice available to you, and will be happy to move to boh or where ever in the spring and help you into germany. I will not ask for any german center, and will support you and focus on the south.\r\n1 FRANCE -> AUSTRIA: that is very annoying... because the move to tus will be blocked, and because I wont get gains elsewhere, specially if I'm even giving up a shot at taking tunis...\n\ni dont understand what kind of -one-sided alliance you have in mind here\r\n2 AUSTRIA -> FRANCE: I don't understand why you want me to support you into munich when it will be blocked. I will be stabbing germany for a move that probably won't pan out. This is the root issue for me.\r\n3 FRANCE -> AUSTRIA: it wont be blocked... i have agreements that sil, ber, and kie will all be cut.\r\n4 AUSTRIA -> FRANCE: Alright. If you have the agreement I will. Also, I know that turkey is allowing russia into the black sea. This isn't good for me. Basically, I want to say that I know I've been hard to negotiate with (as far as me giving), and that was due to my position of being on ok terms with everyone which is rare for AH by now. I think I've figured out the network people are angling, and I agree with you that its in both our best interest to work together. And you definitely need a build. I really suspect england to move ec and nao, and russia to angle to attack me next season. You are right that germany is a lost cause, and I would much rather align with you than him.\n\nWe need to take out italy quickly to have better unit utilization.\n\nI hope this comes as good news to you, and that you sense my sincerity - especially compared to my initial cold attitude.\r\n5 AUSTRIA -> FRANCE: Oh, also for full disclosure's sake, I previously suggested to england to attack you and I said I wouldn't support you to munich. He said he already was going to move there since russia and him are on good terms. This is how I suspect his moves. He expects me not to support you in.\n\nAnd russia wrote me, after I pleaded with him to keep england in check, that he wouldn't attack england at all. So it will basically be me and you verse england and russia. If we could make sure not to piss off germany and turkey as much as them, they may lean in our direction.\r\n6 AUSTRIA -> FRANCE: Sorry for all the press. But would you be willing to skip moving to tuscany and support hold venice, so I can use tyr to support you, and also clear trieste to build a fleet?\r\n7 FRANCE -> AUSTRIA: I do appreciate your messages and I do think we are building the requisite relationship - i'm very hopeful we can keep it through to the end-game, as we'll need each other for sure.\n\nyes, I will use pie to support hold ven, not a problem. thank you for the support into mun.\n\nalso - please do tell me what E has told you... i'm curious how it matches with what he's been telling me.\n\nthank you.\r\n8 AUSTRIA -> FRANCE: I see Englands explosive growth potential and I was trying to limit him to one build by asking him to move on you. He said he would. He said he may support russia to gain a center. He said he expects to only get Denmark since he will move on you. I also told him I would move to piedmont and not support you to negate your build. This will only empower he and russia though.\r\n9 AUSTRIA -> FRANCE: Why don't you just take Belgium??? Russia said he's not cutting silesia and england wrote me concerned about you asking him to ask russia to cut silesia. Just take belgium and you have a guarenteed build and be prepared for england.\r\n10 AUSTRIA -> FRANCE: I don't get why you would risk an only build on a plan with so many x factors.\r\n11 FRANCE -> AUSTRIA: really? is this another one of your pattented 'influence others' messages or are you being the honest ally you promised me you'd be? I hope is you being an honest ally, in which case, I am very appreciative of your shared intel... thank you.\n\n\nin any case. i still hope to have your support for bur to mun.\r\n12 AUSTRIA -> FRANCE: I'm being honest and can copy paste if necessary. England wanted me to isolate your unit in tuscant, slip in pied, and he will move fleets on you, and keep you to no build.\n\nThis is why I question why you wouldn't got for belgium when it is 100% guarenteed.\n\nIf I'm going to put my eggs in a basket with yours, I need you to get a build because ngland is attacking. I'm not going to align myself with you and have russia not cut silesia and [490463] stab you, and you not get a build and be vulnerable. You need a build. Why risk it? Like I said, I can support you to munich, but I don't get the risk and I don't like the risk.\r\n13 FRANCE -> AUSTRIA: you make a strong point... i'm going to think on this...\n\nthe thing is, if I move bur to bel w/ pic support, mun can slip into bur. if I move pic to bel w/ mun support, mun can cut bur anyways...\n\nhave you talked to G at all? he still must trust you... what have u told him and what has he told you.\n\nalso - when we are allied... I expect my ally NOT to try to get my other neighbors to fight me. i understand its part of the game, but I hope you will refrain from telling E to go after me or encouraging him to do the same... be a real ally please.\r\n14 AUSTRIA -> FRANCE: ++ and if you want me to be honest wth you, stop sharing my intel with england. Now he won't work with me and we won't have inside info. Great.\n\nDo you want to work together or no? What's the point in showing that to england and not using it to catch him by surprise?\r\n15 AUSTRIA -> FRANCE: I told e that before I chose to work solely with you. And it could have continued to be useful had you kept sly about it.\r\n16 FRANCE -> AUSTRIA: once bitten twice shy AH... i'd prefer you did not try to be sly about it and instead did not try to get England to turn on me. I had a bad experience with you and E both sharing intel with italy about my intent already...\n\ni am in a situation where I can not trust that you wont spread my plans to others, and I am in a situation where I catch you telling me enemies my moves then encouraging them to attack me... what would you do ifyou were in my shoes.\n\nI am hoping we can be true allies. i've supported you into ven and I'll support you holding in ven. you have plenty of tactical evidence that I AM with you.\n\nas for this coming turn... i will take bel. and I'm going to do a double hit on Tunis instead of the plan to single hit Tys... we'll see how it goes.\r\n17 AUSTRIA -> FRANCE: I understand and see your difficult position. Judging truth is very difficult. I really can't say anything for you to trust me, but know that I encouraged England to attack you before I knew which player I was going to tag with. Before you, it was Russia, and I'm not pegging him to attack me and ally with England. Of course I was trying to cause a bit of confusion for you and England because that benefited me at the time.\n\nNow things are different. You've supported me in, as you said, and just look at the board. The board should speak on my behalf because it's obvious that my best chance is with you, and vise versa, given England's dominance and being the puppetmaster of Russia.\n\nItaly will probably move Ion to Tunis, and I'm going to attack Russia and use Greece to bounce Turkey in Bulgaria. This means that Trieste will move to Budapest to cut retreat and open a fleet port.\n\nI will use Tyrolia to support hold Venice and angle a German connection, since I've been faithful to him and you don't need me to support into Belgium.\n\nI really hope you see these moves and the board to justify that I'm being honest. It is the best option. I will not need Piedmont to support Venice, so if you want to move it to Marseilles or keep it there, that's fine.\n\nI suspect that you and England now came to an agreement since it's all out in the open.\r\n18 AUSTRIA -> FRANCE: &now pegging; not, &not pegging& on the 3rd row.\r\n19 FRANCE -> AUSTRIA: look... i want to trust you, and I do trust that the board suggests you and I should be allied. but until I actually see you supporting me, I dont know how I can see us working together.\n\nI really wanted to see you support me into Munich as a test of your veracity, and now you are making it clear thats not in the cards...\n\nwell, hopefully next year.\n\nI hope we can actually work together next year, I'm looking forward to that happening.\r\n",

        "intent_dialogue": "0 RUSSIA -> ITALY: So much for relaxation on my part...\r\n1 ITALY -> RUSSIA: I don't know if you'll believe me, but I had no clue.\r\n2 ITALY -> RUSSIA: There was no mention & Turkey asked if he can take Trieste after I grab up Munich, then he dismissed it and said that patience is a virtue when it comes to playing Turkey.\r\n3 ITALY -> RUSSIA: I am stressed too, just FYI. If Turkey busts out a bunch of fleet builds, I'd be very much fucked.\r\n4 RUSSIA -> ITALY: There are many pretenders to a solo in this match.\nIt did come through my mind that maybe you knew, or maybe even inspired the stab, but it doesn't really matter, I should have taken steps to prevent, or at least to cushion the actual stab, which was more than predictable. Although I thought you were more vulnerable given the position of the fleets.\r\n5 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Quite so. It's all a bit vicious. Has Turkey spoken to you since? This stab isn't really beneficial to me either, ha. It might push me towards having to work with France, whose relationship with me has been rocky, to say the least. I'm a bit hard-headed with that stuff, which isn't going to do me any favors.\n\nI'm a little out of place to be helping you regain territory, unfortunately, and rather needing Turkey to make any progress towards France - if I still wanted to go down that route - on the off-chance he doesn't stab me. True, though. I am more vulnerable\n\nQuite torn between making a pass at Munich or retreating back to Vie/Tri at the minute.\r\n6 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Perhaps you should just move into Berlin to offset one of those losses?\nI am hoping that you don't go for Vienna, but I rather understand.\r\n7 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Okay, I've climbed over my little grudge fest and reached out to France. He is amenable thus far. So I may be more of an assist to you should you need it, I believe.\r\n8 ITALY -> RUSSIA: I'm in the worst possible position to try and do things against Turkey, but perhaps we can work something out and I'll shuffle around.\r\n9 RUSSIA -> ITALY: If you work together with France, the sheer numerical advantage will decide that you're going to crush the gridlock of the Turkish fleets.\nI'm retreating on the northern front obviously, and certainly not going for VIE. But be careful, as Turkey might! Same applies to TRI.\n\nFunny, in another game, played as Turkey, I got stabbed by Russia today as well.\r\n10 ITALY -> RUSSIA: That's one hundred percent true; my issue right now is about orienting myself in a way where I would be able to attack Turkey's home centres whilst simultaneously not ending up in a situation where mine are laid bare to either T or F. Unfortunately, Italy as I've played it appears to be highly dependent on others so far, haha. My move to PIE is somewhat working against me now that I am switching up.\nAppreciate you not going for VIE! I shall retreat there and to TRI. See if I get any bounces.\nPerhaps we can work together and split up Turkish territory?\r\n11 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Spitting Turkey between you and me is an obvious scenario. However, for now, I am being split lol\r\n12 ITALY -> RUSSIA: As for being stabbed - ouch. It's never fun. My biggest issue occurs when they stab for no apparent reason and cannot finish you off.\r\n13 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Are you going\nUKR -> SEV\nBOH -> GAL\nSIL -> WAR?\nOr are you going to take Berlin? Moving out of Stp/Fin seems a little risky at this point on account of England's presence.\nI'm just predictable with my land units, haha.\r\n14 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Turkey said the option was to either attack me, attack you or to stay still, and he chose to attack you. I confess that I wanted to strike up an alliance with Turkey & T-I is rare and seemed to be an interesting beast to try and tame. Things changed following the Western Triple's appearance.\nWhilst Turkey hasn't done much to aggrieve me (other than not informing me on this stab for understandable reasons), I also realized that he probably chose to stab you because I am more vulnerable. My Western borders/fleets require Turkey's assistance very much, and I have doubts that would change very immediately. Thus, Turkey would always be in a position to consume me readily. If he grabs up your units first with my assistance/support, I'll be next and boom, solo. Maybe I'm getting too creative here, but that's a hypothesis, haha.\r\n15 ITALY -> RUSSIA: We'll do our best to get you unsplit ;)\r\n16 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Yes, my moves are as you've written. Except for FIN poking SWE on request from Germany.\r\n17 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Yup. I think he'll try and reclaim Denmark from England.\r\n18 RUSSIA -> ITALY: That's his idea, I suppose. I've decided not to take BER in (naive) hopes that Germany would help me against England, so that I have at least this flank 'secured'.\r\n19 ITALY -> RUSSIA: I do believe that Germany will work with you. So perhaps less naive and more gracious, haha. It's not necessarily a bad trait at all.\n\nAs for me, well, any move against Turkey at the moment risks a slip into the Adriatic where either Venice or Trieste will be painfully exposed. France has yet to believe that I am no longer working with Turkey, so I suppose I shall have to hold everything and wing it the best I can...\r\n20 ITALY -> RUSSIA: &yet to fully believe. He's offered helping me into Ionian or Tyrrhenian - though he favors Ionian where I do not on account of Adriatic retreat. It's frustrating to all of a sudden be rather at a loss with \"allies\" on all fronts, haha. The only person I feel locked in to aid is you, presently.\r\n21 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Thank you for your kind words.\nIt's in fact pretty interesting that Turkey, with 6 units, can hold both of us (11 units combined) in check.\r\n22 ITALY -> RUSSIA: No worries whatsoever!\nThis is very true. It is likely down to my poor positioning and hastiness to hand over reigns.\nA Budapest support move into Trieste is going to be rough on me in the next turn. Hmm.\r\n23 RUSSIA -> ITALY: I am not sure if Turkey is going to pick up a fight with you.\r\n24 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Man, I feel bad then, haha. I'm gonna end up the the Tyrrhenian Sea next turn, I believe.\nHe just responded to me that Russia (you) might as well take Munich/Berlin. Did he talk to you about it? Seems like his idea was that you'd continue working together or something...?\r\n25 ITALY -> RUSSIA: This is what Turkey said to me:\n12:32 PM I'm just taking the two for now. But I understand Russia feeling the need to pull back. Still, they can't take back anything I took this turn so they might as well try to get Mun to make up for the loss right?\n12:32 PM Sometimes the answer is to keep looking forward\r\n26 RUSSIA -> ITALY: We haven't spoken since the stab. It's clear to me that he's going to try to push further into me, therefore I didn't feel the need to talk to him. Neither did he, apparently.\r\n27 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Right, right, makes sense. I was unsure about that. I pushed and asked him, but he didn't respond with any plans/clear definitions until now (after we've had a delay).\nI was second-guessing a little after that last message. Thank you for your affirmation.\r\n28 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Would you, by any chance, be willing to support moving Tyrolia into Munich in this turn and slipping Silesia into Galicia instead? I will be going to Tyrrh Sea, but I am worried about having not enough Scs to cover Venice/Trieste should Ionian slip into Adriatic.\n\nWould totally understand if you are resistant to the idea, though!\r\n29 ITALY -> RUSSIA: I'm thinking aloud a little bit.\r\n30 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Never mind! All good.\r\n",

Time to send in the cavalry!\n\nThe really crazy thing is that he has dropped his defence but hasn't even bothered trying to talk me into agreeing to leave him alone. There's no helping some people...\r\n4 GERMANY -> ITALY: hahaha interesting way of doing diplomacy :)\n\nAnyway, are you going to move to Gas then? (don't worry i have no intention in attacking you, be sure of that)\r\n5 ITALY -> GERMANY: I am never sure of anything, you can be sure of that ;).\n\nI've been toying with the idea of Gas, but haven't decided if I can afford to move my army too far west. I am rather light in land based units and certain players could take advantage of the fact.\n\nWhat are your goals for the year? I think coordination over the two phases is our best approach.\r\n6 GERMANY -> ITALY: My goal is to take Brest (and for that i need you in Gas...if possible) and try to take Hol.\n\nAfter that, my idea is to continue working with you, that means that we will have t search for another target, don't you think so? Ideas?\r\n7 ITALY -> GERMANY: Russia seems the obvious choice, nice chap though he is, and it would move us in the general direction of a 3 way with Turkey.\n\nWe could even attempt a two way if you like. Generally speaking I'm against them, but on the basis I'm not going to win this tournament and would find the outrage it would generate extremely entertaining I am quite willing to give it a go.\n\nIt also helps having a neighbour I genuinely get on with :p.\r\n8 ITALY -> GERMANY: You'll be taking Hol in the spring, I take it, and trying to disband his fleet?\r\n9 GERMANY -> ITALY: Deciding about that yet... referring to Eurasia, totally agree!\r\n",

I find it a little odd that Germany actually withdrew from France, I was kinda hoping they would keep each other busy..\r\n1 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Indeed. I think you scared them. I'm also intrigued by your support of Germany into North sea and his support of Warsaw and Sweden. Curious moves for a press game. In gunboat I could see it, but in press? Strange days indeed. I wonder what is going on there.\r\n2 RUSSIA -> ITALY: I offered him support in hopes he'd move the rest of his shit that way too.. He only sent a single message back with less than 5 hours left in the phase saying he'd appreciate the support, has been super busy, yadda yadda, so its almost like playing a no press game with him ><\r\n3 RUSSIA -> ITALY: So whats the plan this turn?\n\nGreece to Bulgaria with support from Serbia, Rumania\nIonian to Greece with support from Albania\nAdriatic to Ionian\nBlack to Con\nTrie to Tyrolia? Do you want to start a norther offensive?\r\n4 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Yes, I think that is a good plan. I'd like to start a northern offensive, but I will need these builds before I can start with it. Are you heading at Germany next?\r\n5 RUSSIA -> ITALY: He seems like the next logical target, though if you'd rather work with him and go after France next I could build northern fleets to help with that\r\n6 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Essentially, I just want to be a part of the likely draw and would be perfectly fine if that was a 3 or 4 person endeavor.\r\n7 ITALY -> RUSSIA: ok. I think Germany and France are pretty good allies at this point. Germany is definitely worried about you, so I'd bethinking about getting those armies in position.\r\n8 RUSSIA -> ITALY: I'm getting the feeling that you're not liking our current arrangement. If you were to stab me this turn, sure, you could get Vienna or Budapest. Is that one SC from me worth throwing away our relationship? I feel like that would be very little gain compared to what you'd get if we continued to work together. As with Austria we can dispatch Turkey quickly and efficiently, then you'd be open to strike at France's defenseless underbelly.\r\n9 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Well, I'm mostly worrying about a stab from your end, truth be told. I do think that the plan is a good one. Romania supports Greece to Bulgaria and you cut Constantinople, right? Otherwise Turkey probably blocks us I am trying to keep a good enough relationship with Turkey to get a sense of what he is up to.\r\n10 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Between the two of us you are in the position of power, with the opportunity to grab some of my Scs. Granted, Turkey is much more set to attack you than me, we can dismantle him pretty easily if you decide you're still with me.\r\n11 ITALY -> RUSSIA: That's quite true. Let's proceed. Turkey worries me\r\n12 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Please reiterate what the plan is for me.\r\n13 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Romania supports Greece to Bulgaria. Black Sea cuts constaninople. That sets us to for aegaen and Ankara etc next year. Sound good?\r\n14 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Sounds good!\r\n",

It would be bad if he build a fleet against you or an army to threaten galicia.\r\n2 AUSTRIA -> ENGLAND: Oh, I missed your msg. France has spent the entire retreat begging me to support him in. He thinks I will. So plan accordingly.\r\n3 ENGLAND -> AUSTRIA: Thanks.\r\n4 ENGLAND -> AUSTRIA: So France is begging me to get Russia to attack Sil, I am assuming this is because he is hoping to get your support into Munich.\r\n5 AUSTRIA -> ENGLAND: I don't know. I told him I was supporting. He didn't say anything about sil to me.\r\n6 ENGLAND -> AUSTRIA: Gotcha. With Italy retreating to Tus, can you get his army out of Pie?\r\n7 AUSTRIA -> ENGLAND: I guess it depends what italy does. We may bounce. Not sure how to ensure he takes tuscany without bouncing.\r\n8 ENGLAND -> AUSTRIA: I have been informed that France has information from Austria about my impending stab. Very disapointing to hear you sharing our plans about the moves.\r\n9 AUSTRIA -> ENGLAND: It really matters? What is different? I weighed the option, and nothing he does can change anything. The benefit to me is I will have one less flt in the south and we catch him in transition. But mostly I had to get him to trust that I would support him to munich. I would have used that example if it was true or not because it is a believable and very good moveset.\r\n",

I do think it is the better idea and it is what I plan on doing this turn. Thanks again for the support.\r\n3 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: Try to ignore Russia's global comments. I will build a fleet in Smyrna and attack Italy next year. In the long term I plan on building primarily fleets and expanding west through the Mediterranean (I assume you'll build mainly armies). ~N~ ~N~ I do not intend to attack you. This is a five game series and I don't think that it would be a very good strategy to become known in the first game as a player who backstabs at the first opportunity. ~N~ ~N~\r\n4 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: [839168], i need to work with you to create a safe border for us. i would really like to see us try to move this game forward in an alliance but it needs to be a safe one for austrian. so i need the fleet in sevas to either stay there or not stay in the black sea beyond one turn to transit to cons. my rumnian can provide support hold for your sevas. ~N~ ~N~ to that end i was wondering hoew you felt about these moves, ~N~ you move sevas to black sea and armenia to sevas, i move rumania to sevas, we clasht ehre- so moscow cannot take it back. it stays yellow. then next trun armenia moves there with rumanian support. black sea moves to cons. ~N~ austrian is worried that our alliance will come under strain if you have to many troops on our border and a good opportunity to break the treaty. i have no cause to break the treaty, i cannot take any of your sc.\r\n5 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: \"clash there\" ~N~ , sorry miss typing\r\n6 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: i will work on getting warsaw.\r\n7 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: That is exactly the problem with our position. Our border is such that it is difficult for us to safely garrison it without having lots of troops there. Your proposal is very sensible but before I commit I want to see where Russia places his build. ~N~ ~N~ The big advantage would be that I can get an extra fleet into the Med where it will be much more useful. My concerns are that during the transition I will be vulnerable to losing Sevastopol and Bulgaria and also that Sevastopol is less secure when supported from Rumania than from Armenia (since the support can be cut at Rumania) ~N~ ~N~ An alternate proposal (just a suggestion, I actually that it is a worse option) is that I withdraw from Bulgaria. ~N~\r\n8 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: That last part should read \"I actually think that it is a worse option\"\r\n9 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY:  you could leave the fleet in sevas, but it is a kind of waste of the fleet. ok lets see where russia builds. i suspect an army in warsaw sadly\r\n10 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: this is a message i sent russia.(it is about a peaceful border between all of us. he gets to rebuild ,without sevas so any action he takes hurts germany or england not us and we get a secure northern border and most importantly Not an extra russian army in warsaw, here is the message, ~N~ ~N~ (to russia) you have a build right? if you want the border between us to remain quiet i recommend you build in st petes. england has shown a quite strong streak in short term stabbing, he allied with germany then turned around and stabbed him straight away. so i would worry about st petes rather than warsaw. maybe you and turkey could come to a deal? turkey leaves the fleet in sevas and in return you build in st petes, ukraine becomes a dmz. then we all have a quite border, you get to rebuild your northern defences, england doesnt jump ahead of us and we are all happy. england will cut up france [677709] quickly i think and germany is gone maybe. ~N~ ~N~ what do you think?\r\n11 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: I've already sent a message to Russia informing him that I have no designs on Moscow (I have a fleet in Sevas so I couldn't do anything anyway) and that St Pete is a very tempting target for England. ~N~ ~N~ I would probably go for the proposal that you presented to Russia, although, as you send, it feels like a waste to have a fleet in Sevas. However, the proposal doesn't address the concerns that you have & being surrounded by Turkish forces. ~N~\r\n",

You can even move Sweden to Finland and obtain my support in St-p if Austria decides to play funny. With you in NTH, it makes no real difference what unit I keep on the board.\nAll that to say: I'm certainly not a threat and I'm actually in a wonderful position to help you progress while I stagnate (which is still better than death!).\r\n2 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: well, with your unit in Ech, neither North nor Lon are safe at this point. I was willing to concede Lon back to you had you chosen to disband Ech, but you have chosen not to do that.\n\nI am not about to leave swe open to you or open a new front now that you are endangering north sea.\r\n3 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: If I were to come up with a concrete and detailed offer, would you give it a shot?\n\nYou understand that I'm not on this map to sit silently. The position in which you would like to reduce me is perfectly uninteresting and it is far too early in the game for me to feel like it's my only avenue. I think it fair to say that you stand a much better chance of peace in the north with a semi-content England than with a fully disillusioned one.\n\nLondon is safe. I've disbanded in Yor for that very reason. I also disbanded there to show an open face on my island and make sure you'd get the signal that, though I moved somewhat differently than what you had ordered, I'm not trying to show strength or threaten your positions. Hells, you can convoy there if you'd like now!\n\nNorway gives me a little shot at raising myself to 4 units. It cannot threaten Sweden nor Den without putting me quite out of position. And if you don't tell me what you do, I'll be assuming you to move exactly as you said, i.e. against me. Meanwhile, if you move Den to Swe (for security), Swe to Fin, Kiel to Bal (you can even move it to Hel if you want, but it's not as effective I think), you can count on my full support in the fall to move to St-p. You'll then have a shot at Norway if you really want one.\n\nIf I can do that, and I have a fleet in the channel, I can convoy my built army in France and slowly secure the west, blocking Italy's progress if he tries for any. Get me up to 5 units, I blockade MAO.\n\nAlso, Edi is absolutely ready to be convoyed straight to France in the Spring if we want to. It will leave my island wide open to your attacks (huge guarantee) and it could help take Brest (Pic supports, Bur hits Paris) to secure you Paris in the Fall.\n\nI think my disbands leave you with more options than what you had in mind. I also think they do not yell my continued collaboration with you as your suggestions would have, giving me a slight chance to hear what will happen in Russia, France, Italy and... Austria.\r\n4 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: England... i have been mulling your offer here and I can't say that I'm convinced its my best bet. even though I'd love to believe that you would convoy to bre, i cant imagine a player of your quality doing that. my interaction with other players also leads me to believe you intend to \"stick it to me\" for the time being.\n\nAll that said, i'm also not ready to give up North. not at all. so I still have some thinking to do.\n\none thing I would consider is if you were willing to take stp and let me take norway. you'd move to either bar or stp while I move to norway with the army...\n\nalternatively, i'd still be open to you moving ech to MAO and me moving Nth to Ech. but really not the northern plan you had envisioned for me.\n\nI'm still mulling things over and have not finalized my orders so I'm in the consideration phase.\r\n5 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Of course I've tried my best to mess you up! :-)\n\nTo no avail though. And I want to survive.\n\nI'll move to St-p. Take Nor with Swe if you must.\nI still think the convoy to Brest is your best available move in the west. It secures me as an ally (for you will leave my island and I will have a strategically placed unit), it gives you a shot at Paris and me one at Brest later.\n\nI have other ideas. But you have my word: the fleet in the Channel serves no other purpose than to convoy you to Brest and keep the game interesting for me.\r\n6 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: hmm....\n\nso channel WILL convoy Lon to Bre? i seriously doubt this... but I'm willing to give it a try. if you do also move to norway and let me take it behind you, then you can take Lon and I wont mind.\n\nhmmm....\n\nwhen will you last check this game before the deadline? I will give you an answer soon.\r\n7 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I'd say [1539693] eastern time is my last visit.\n\nAnd yes, I commit to that: I will convoy you into Brest. And no, I'm not asking you to commit to letting me have Brest right away as I'm in no position to make any demands at this point. I will say this though: let's work towards a DMZ in NTH as you want, but let's do it in a way that gives me a chance to grow a bit. I'm willing to build fleets only in Liverpool if I can count on your help for Brest and Spain. I will set up a stalemate line there and you'll be able to roam freely in the east.\n\nBut if I can't have that, if I can't have that little, what's the point, right? I love this game because it there's always a way to \"play\" it, even when you're down to almost nothing. But your attitude towards me after my refusal to DMZ the NTH has been making it impossible for me to play: your orders are strict and our communications one-way. My \"threat\" on the global channel was actually the expression of my desire to put an end to a cycle of phases where I would have no chance to enjoy the game.\n\nSo just to be clear: I'm not asking you to give me anything that would endanger you, but I am asking, in return for that convoy to Brest, that you consider making our collaboration a touch more dynamic and involving for all. As you can see, this is not exactly a demand (see first paragraph!) but a plea for your consideration. If you deem me a good player, and you've suggested thus a few times, give me a chance to be a real partner here.\n\nEspecially in light of France and Italy's recent conversations...\r\n8 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: My orders are in.\n\nIf you don't take the convoy, please let me know. I don't want to look like a fool and convoy a unit that's busy trying to take my other centres! I guess I'm politely asking you to be frank with me and tell me if you're turning my partnership down.\r\n9 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I will give you a final answer before [1539693]. for now, you have made a convincing enough argument. my order now is for Lon to bre and swe to norway. I'm fine with a North DMZ at some point and I think that is a legitimate desire on your part.\n\nI will get back to you regarding the other points you have raised.\r\n10 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Very well. Thank you for considering my offer. I'm likely going to help you to a solo, but at this point, I see only too well that it's either that or I'm out. And \"out\" doesn't get any chance to draw now, does it...\r\n11 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Also, know that if I don't get to hear from you in time for a reason or another, my current moves are to convoy Lon to Brest and move Nor to St-p.\n\nSo if we should meet with communication issues, these orders will not change.\r\n12 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: sounds good thank you. and my current orders are for swe to norway and Lon to bre.\r\n",

I must get another build somewhere as I'm going to lose St Petersburg.\r\n2 ITALY -> RUSSIA: I do not trust Austria... Well, I stabbed him. He will probably try for Trieste himself so I need to support between Tyrolia and Trieste. You are correct about Serbia and Greece. I am waiting for Turkey to be reduced and have to watch that Ionian fleet carefully. If you can get Bud, I would look greedily towards Vienna myself next turn...\r\n3 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Doubt I'm going to be able to get Bud - Rumania is a fleet, and I'll need a new build in Sevastapol before I can kill Budapest by myself - otherwise I need your support. ~N~ ~N~ If I attack Budapest with Galicia, can you not get into Vienna? Trieste will be safe.\r\n4 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Yes, that would work fine. I would welcome that arrangement because it will clear the Austrian Fop out of our Imperial way... ~N~ ~N~ Okay, I will order Tyrolia into Vienna, supported by Trieste. Thanks. The favour will be returned.\r\n5 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Multo bene! I know I won't get that extra build this year, but one next year would be useful indeed. Then I can focus up north against Germany and keep out of your way.\r\n6 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Much appreciated. ~N~ ~N~ Oh, just out of interest, when was the last time either of us stabbed the other? I suspect a sudden increase in the sales of [106215]...\r\n7 ITALY -> RUSSIA:  ~N~ Er, make that stilettos... We do not need lots of shoes.\r\n8 RUSSIA -> ITALY: I can't recall the last time we stabbed each other - there was that rather awkward stab when I was in Sri [599936]? It didn't work out very well, and I only survived with two units. Ahem. Although thinking about it I'm sure there was a game a couple of months ago. ~N~ ~N~ Maybe we just work very well together? After all, I am a very trustworthy person, am I not...?\r\n9 RUSSIA -> ITALY: And no, I don't need [106215], though my girlfriend does. She's a whole foot shorter than me in flats.\r\n10 ITALY -> RUSSIA:  ~N~ btw Nice article on the Ken Vs Boris affair in the Economist (I think it is [779190])... Now there are two men in whom we can entrust the affairs of the Capital.\r\n11 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Don't! I've got enough to worry about without competency questions. My job is to turn out the [1493605] vote... I'll pick up the Economist later and read it - they are usually quite good. Boris' team if he gets in will be very heavy on experience, so less chance of a cock up (hopefully).\r\n12 RUSSIA -> ITALY: NB - How did I fail to get into Berlin? Denmark attacked Kiel for me, which should have cut the support? Unless Kiel was the one moving, but surely that still should have worked? ~N~ ~N~ Bit buggered up North now, without an extra unit to work around. Now have to rely on your goodwill to get me into Budapest...\r\n13 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Such goodwill will be extended... ~N~ ~N~ I am getting concerned about England.\r\n14 RUSSIA -> ITALY: England? Porquoi?\r\n15 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Seems to be having a trouble-free ride and will likely take from Germany soon.\r\n16 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Yes I know. Not exactly the best option for me, but I'm stretched rather thinly, so I have to rely on him. I'll be screwed if he takes Sweden. If we can crush Budapest early on in the spring, then I can get the fleet out of Rumania and send it to get at Ankara and get rid of those fleets. Watch out that Ionian doesn't move to venice if it gets into Adriatic.\r\n17 ITALY -> RUSSIA: That is why I am in Apu and Naples... Covering Venice and Rome...\r\n",

I hope Italy doesn't stay in tri with supports.\nI will inform Austria.\r\n5 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: ok.\r\n6 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: ok I sent him a msg saying he will have vie and ser support into tri\r\n7 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: alright. hope he accepts it.\r\n8 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: Italy responded to the call to move to tyr with\n\"Turkey is clearly attacking you.

I think you should rethink.\"\nI told him this was planned.\r\n9 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: Italy says we don't provide enough motive to move to tyr\nI told him he's the one that has to provide us motive to keep him alive.\nFuck him. It's the kind of arrogant bitch high esteem player that gets destroyed first in games like that.\nAustria says he will move to tri with our support\nSo combining with your plan:gal-bud, boh s vie hold, vie s bud-tri, smy-gre, gre-alb, con-smy, ank-con, sev hold, rum s ser hold and ser support bud-tri.\nright?\r\n10 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: hey are you there?\r\n11 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: yeah, sorry. i'm really busy with school, so i'm usually not on till this time.\n\nyup. totally agree with you on italy. and good to go on the moves as well. :)\r\n12 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: ok man\nI'm finalizing them then\r\n13 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: italy's also told me that france is backing him...and i think that's actually true, coz it'd benefit france. if that's the case, we shouldn't be so quick to jump on germany. so definitely not the next year i think. but if italy isn't allied with france, we should still try and be careful about jumping germany.\r\n14 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: that makes sense.\nItaly is to eager to attack Germany\nI totally agree with you\nI will not attack Germany if Italy is allied with France.\nIf they are not then we can defeat Italy and then I can use my forces to go against G while you focus on France.\r\n15 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: & too eager\r\n",

We're losing on all fronts, and it doesn't look like we'd be able to draw any stalemate line anywhere anytime soon. The western trio is getting the momentum.\r\n1 ITALY -> RUSSIA: I am incredibly frustrated, ha. France has been non-communicative since he lied to me, and Germany does not want to communicate either. It would be preferable if we do not lose, haha. But I can't quite spot anything that might turn the situation around for us at the moment either.\r\n2 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Any idea what you'd like to do this move?\r\n3 RUSSIA -> ITALY: There's indeed not much we can do at this moment. I'm only hoping one of the trio will get greedy. So I'm keeping my eyes peeled to spot any chance to break their unity.\nIn terms of tactics, I must prevent the convoy into LVN at all costs. STP is lost, but it's a bottleneck, so I can plug it up at LVN-MOS line, it may withstand some pressure. But I also worry that Turkey will break down at some point at stab us in order to secure his seat in a 4-way draw.\r\n4 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Mmm, Germany knows he's the weak link. I can try niggling at him, but everything has been falling on deaf ears thus far. So long as they continue advancing in breaking our defenses, I doubt they would turn on one another.\n\nI'm not sure Turkey has a seat in a 4-way draw following that last move. France offered him Naples and Venice, promising to support move his Ionian fleet to Naples. Needless to say, neither party carried out those orders.\r\n5 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Plugging at LVN-MOS line sounds like a plan. Can you spare Galicia and shuffle him back into Budapest? I wanna just bite the bullet on that hopefully-not-death-sentence and go for Tyrolia to Vienna. If Germany claims another SC, that is going to be &rough&.\r\n6 RUSSIA -> ITALY: I'm tempted to gamble, and go:\nGAL -> BUD\nWAR -> GAL\nand you could go:\nTYR -> VIE s TRI\r\n7 ITALY -> RUSSIA: [190899] that makes my palm damp with sweat, ahhh. I am just concerned because you have no build for Warsaw incoming. Moscow-liv has to stay there too.\n\nI'm trying to weasel info from Germany, but he's done talking for today, I think. No clues as to where he's moving this turn :(\r\n8 ITALY -> RUSSIA: I have TYR -> VIE s TRI at the moment.\nThen ADR to APU.\r\n9 ITALY -> RUSSIA: I pressed Germany a little. Nothing solid. Just asked what would get him comfy to turn on E-F. He said a defense line from Kiel to Naples would be good. Following that, I mentioned I need Vienna to fight off France, and he's said he will \"evade\" that. Unsure of exactly what this means/whether he is lying. But, I don't believe he is being deceitful on account of how ambiguous the messages are and tentatively theorize that he will be moving to Budapest with Vienna.\n\nI wanted to update you so that you can make a more informed decision. And also to reassure you that I'm T-R-I alliance all the way in spite of anything that occurs through the rather silent grapevine.\n\nI also spoke to Turkey about \"end game\" desires and he states that he likes the idea of playing the long game for an eventual T-R-I.\n\nKinda heart-warming, hey? I hope we make it.\r\n",

He certainly must suspect you will turn on him once you don't need him for cracking open Turkey. Perhaps he wishes to delay the inevitable, or be better positioned for it.\r\n",

Sorry for the double line.\r\n3 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: [151052] keeps sending me messages on how you're planning on attacking me. He is just trying to sow dissension between us, but it is disconcerting none the less.\r\n4 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: yup, he is doing the same thing with me! he has a 50% win rate ...... and now we see why.\r\n5 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: i suspect he may try tuscanny convoy via tyrr sea and ionain sea to albania. ~N~ or go for tyrolia.\r\n6 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: If nothing else it is instructive playing against him. He actually sends me (some) of the messages that you send him. In my exchanges with him I don't ever completely rebuff him, I try to get him to move his forces west - I looks like you are doing the same thing.\r\n7 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: he has sent me some of your messages too...but are they really? could be just stuff he wrote. ~N~\r\n8 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: here is one he claimed you set ~N~ ~N~ \" i need to control the ionian if we are to agree to this treaty. i will help you attain triest if i am the master of serbia \"\r\n9 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: No, I didn't write that. I am impressed though. I'm always hesitant when people claim to be passing messages word for word, they could just be making stuff up. I try to compare the sentence structure and word choice of the message to the various messages that I have received from the other parties. This is sometimes enough to catch forgeries. But in this case the messages that [151052] sends me from \"you\" are different in tone from the messages he sends you that he claims are from \"me\" and these are different in tone from the direct communication that he has with me. Impressive.\r\n10 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: Here's a message that he claimed was from you: ~N~ ~N~ \"if you can see a way for me to crack open turkey then please tell me. ~N~ 12:21 AM if Tuscany were to move away south then i would feel able to attack turkey. ~N~ a convoy to albania would be most inappropriate! i know you need to safeguard the ionain but in the meduim to long term i canot have you taking greeece and some turkish SC, that would be like italy having an open hand cupped around austria's balls....quite scary for me! ~N~ ~N~ were you to go west...except for thr one fleet in ionain that could help me with turkey then i can see a way for us to maintain peaceful relations\"\r\n11 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: hey, some of that message is mine. i said the bit about warning him i suspected a convoy move to albania and i also the nit about italy taking you would be like a hand around my balls, quite scary for me. ~N~ ~N~ [151052] added the first bit and the last bit. im impressed too.\r\n12 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: it is interesting because i played another game with [151052], a no press game so i didn't get all this.\r\n13 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: I am leaving serbia and rumania on defensive support hold duties. ~N~\r\n14 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: other units are moving west/north\r\n15 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: I can see how this sort of tactic would be very effective for a single game. It will be interesting to see how it plays out over a 5 game series. ~N~ ~N~ I'm holding with Bulgaria/Con. Moving Smyrna to Armenia. Ank to Bla. Gre to Ion ~N~\r\n16 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: russia really wants to ally with me and work with italy to attack you. [151052] almost never mentions russia in his press but russia quite openly says italy is his ally.\r\n17 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: russia thinks i will go for germany.\r\n18 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: im very interested to see what italy does. russia is getting depressed, i can see why. germany will make mince meat of france. england could be a power broker for the west.\r\n19 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: Early on Italy keep mentioning that I should work with Russia to attack you. He gradually stopped doing that. I think that he may have given up on Russia. ~N~ ~N~ I thought Germany and Russia were working together to take Scandinavia. I guess not. ~N~ ~N~ I'll support Smyrna into Armenia next turn. Then if you can support with Rumania (and Italy doesn't move East) I can take Sevastopol next year.\r\n20 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: seems italy and i have stopped talking and dancing around and are now fully at war\r\n21 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: Italy is now really pressuring me to attack you. I will continue to delay and make excuses (I really need Sevastopol), although at some point he'll realize that I have no intention in following through. ~N~ ~N~ Germany was looking pretty good, but with Russia's surprise move to Silesia he's looking somewhat squeezed. ~N~ ~N~ Speaking of Russia what are your intentions? Are you just focusing on fending off Italy now? ~N~ ~N~\r\n22 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: yes. i had to decide if i was going to take advantage of his weakness and go for warsaw(A) OR take advantage of his weakness and have anothr peaceful border in galica and spend my resources elsewhere(B) so i went for option B ~N~ ~N~ just as well because italy launced a full on attack at me, he moved to adr and tyrolia. as i did too\r\n23 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: Actually now that I think about it, could you support me into Sevastopol this turn? If Sevas tries to bounce again in Armenia a supported Black Sea will take it. If Sevastopol stays and defends, Smyrna will take Armenia.\r\n24 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: england getting big is good for us for the meduim term.\r\n25 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: How so? Is it that if England is strong in the medium term, Germany and France (who are in a position to fight us) will be weaker?\r\n26 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: yes, long term it isnt good but. maybe i will move to albania? then i can support you into ionian? or you can support mr into ionain? im not sure how i can get venice. i might give up and keep a aggressive defensive line and then return to warsaw. im not sure right now\r\n27 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: The problem with my position is that since I built an army in Smyrna and one of my fleets is bottled up in the Black Sea, I'm not in the best position to fight Italy. Now if I captured Sevastopol and got a fleet in Smyrna that would be a different story. ~N~ ~N~ Was that a \"yes\" on the support in Sevastopol?\r\n28 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: of course.\r\n29 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: especially if you build a fleet to help me with italy.\r\n30 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: long term i want to discuss the ending of this game. ~N~ with this high level of play i dont think a single win is possible, indeed the way the point structure in the league games is set up a 3 or 4 way draw is best. 2 way draws are impossible. so if we aim for a 3 way draw who should we discuss it with? england? he might try for a solo victory if he is big enogh but if i am a land power with many armies i can stop him getting germany. anyway this is all in the future\r\n31 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: Thanks for the support. If I get the build, I'll be a fleet in Smyrna ~N~ ~N~ England is a good choice. I've had a decent relationship with him up to this point. Turkey and England are natural long term allies. If he takes St. Petersburg, Scandinavia and Northern Germany I think he will be at a stalemate line anyway. What is the best way to approach him?\r\n",

That would leave the situation ambiguous insofar as the near future is concerned. Also wondering whether you're willing to (preferably) support Bul Con from the Black Sea or at least hit Ank to cut support, and whether there is something I can do for you this turn.\r\n2 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: Yea, I think about our builds this year, we are ready to move toward Germany. What do you think about a triple draw with France?\n\nBlack Sea will support you to Con. Do you have plans to stifle Italy at Smyrna?\n\nI will also blow some smoke screen to Italy to confuse him.\r\n3 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: Yes to triple draw, thanks for support, not sure about Smyrna but hopefully! :) Mind if I move into Gal so I can (hopefully) build again in Vie in prevision of our German campaign? At some point we should be able to do Gal-sie and War-pru together.\r\n4 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: Instead of moving into Galicia, why don't we move toward Germany this turn, say Vie to Boh and Warsaw to Silesia. If we get France on board, Munich is ours next year. What do you think?\r\n5 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: A couple questions: first, do we know that France is on board, and that he really is committed. second, my prospects for capture in germany are extremely thin. i might get munich if the french is nice, and then what? i have no problem with you getting more out of this than i (after all, you're being awfully nice about ankara and the like), but if things are getting a bit too unbalanced, i would like to be reassured that readjustments are possible (through conceding rumania, for instance).\r\n6 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: Good points. We will have to make sure France is on board. I am waiting for his response. Perhaps you can write to him too.\n\nI see your concern regarding balance. So this is what I'll propose. All of Turkey is yours; I will either sail out Black Sea into the Med Sea or station it at Sevastopol. Munich is yours; I will try to split the rest of Germany with France. I do not intent to take any of the English centers, and the Italian centers are between you and France.\n\nThis is a WTA game, so going solo is nearly impossible (unless the other players go on tilt). Going 2-way is too unstable because of the temptation to stab. So I think 3-way ties is the most ideal. I think a F-A-R alliance would make this an easy game.\n\nFeel free to adjust the plan.\r\n7 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: If possible, I would like to leave Galicia DMZ. :)\r\n8 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I'm on board with this, and wrote France. And no worries about Gal.\r\n9 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: Apparently France is on.\r\n",

I dont know why he let you walk into VEN...maybe you do? ~N~ do you want me to support SIL-BER?\r\n3 AUSTRIA -> ENGLAND: no , im worried that france will try for munich so silesia might support hold munich. i really think we need to say goodbye to russia and italy soon. once they are out of the way turkey can threaten the soft underbelly of france and i can take burg and from their we can get a 3 way draw between us. ~N~ ~N~ so i hope that neither of us will help the small powers from now on, its their time to go im afraid. if we use them than there is a chance, a small chance that tthey might get big again, look at russia, a few years ago he was looking nearly finished but he signed a peace deal with you in the north and turkey was stuck with a fleet in sevas and he could survive and grow a bit. ~N~ ~N~ basically i mean if you dont help russia(in berlin) or italy i wont help france(into kiel)\r\n4 AUSTRIA -> ENGLAND: france wants my help supporting ruhr into kiel, ~N~ if i do it can you support hold kiel with helb? then i can keep feeding you his plans. if i dont support him then he will stop telling me stuff. ~N~ he said he told you that he wants munich but his real plan is to use ruhr to attack kiel and wants my suppprt. i will support him if you can support hold keil from helb. ~N~ dont really want france to get more units into germany really!\r\n5 ENGLAND -> AUSTRIA: hmm..dont do that! if russia helps too then he WILL get into Kiel\r\n6 ENGLAND -> AUSTRIA: thanks...i owe you one ~N~ ~N~ Whats next? how can I help you?\r\n7 AUSTRIA -> ENGLAND: stop helping russia, kill of france and call a 3 way draw sounds just about right:) ~N~\r\n8 ENGLAND -> AUSTRIA: i agree to stop helping russia ~N~ I will do my best against France (but would welcome some help!) - can you support Kiel to Ruhr? If you can that will give me unstoppable momentum against France and Ill see you in Italy\r\n9 AUSTRIA -> ENGLAND: i can help you if your fleet in west med can help turkey and finish off italy. ~N~ ~N~ so do you think heading towards a 3 way draw is ok? sure we cant decide now, russia,france and italy need finishing off. but after that we will need to discuss it. im not interested in a 2 way draw, they are almost impossible to set up.\r\n10 AUSTRIA -> ENGLAND: kiel to ruhr? ok. i would feel safer if you replaced that army with a fleet and kept our border at kile,ruhr,burg(your side) berlin munich(my side) ~N~ can you work with turkey to take tunis? if so munich can continue to help you move into burgandy\r\n11 ENGLAND -> AUSTRIA: working towards 3 way draw is fine with me ~N~ I am happy with the border you propose in the centre and I will keep fleet in Kiel ~N~ I will help Turkey into TUN if he helps me into STP next turn ~N~ Does that work?\r\n",

I told him that if I started a war with you, or vice versa, he would end up getting most of my Scs, if not all, and Germany would most likely get all of your Scs, so his suggestions are just stupid.

        "intent_dialogue": "0 FRANCE -> GERMANY: Hi Germany,\n\nSo this was really good for us both I think, and congratulations on your move to Nth! Which is always huge.\n\nWe are approaching the end of the early game, and the next phases will be essential for us both.\n\nA question I had first, concerns the press you sent me regarding attacking Russia, while the eventual move shows the opposite. There is the possibility that you changed it after you received my message but somehow I feel like that is not the case. Were you cautious in trusting me with information that you'd be attacking England rather than Russia after I turned my fleet south last time? Or is there anything else I should know about?\n\nI ask this because we are also close to conquering and dividing England between the both of us, and need to determine new targets after that. In this regard some thoughts.\n\nThis turn. If you would want to go after England, one of the moves that come to mind is getting you into Lon. I could have my Eng fleet support you in and my guess is that England will move in the opposite direction and cover Edi. The alternative is that you move into Yor (which will likely be open) and follow-up into Nth to take Edi and Lon next year.\n\nAdditionally, I would also be fine with reorganizing and let you have Bel while I take Lon instead. Given Hol and Bel's proximity, that would allow us to devote less armies to our borders and defence. This year would be too early for such a move as it implies to many risks, but next year would be an option.\n\nAnd what about after? I think it is probably desirable that we stick to our original plan: you attacking Russia while I move in on Italy. I am rather confident we can take them. Thus far, you have had an excellent understanding not only with me, but also with Russia, so I am being a little careful here.\n\nHappy to hear your thoughts.\nFrance\r\n1 GERMANY -> FRANCE: France,\nWhen it comes to High Stakes Diplomacy games, I prefer to make major moves during the fall, usually that comes with the element of surprise. And Since I wasn't interested in moving my troops. I think that showing suspicion towards as strong an ally as you to the rest of the players is rarely a bad thing.\nAs for the future, Post-england, I think the plan of you eliminating Italy while I start after Russia should go well for the both of us. Particularly with the inherent speed that I could attack Warsaw.\nSincerely,\nGermany.\r\n2 FRANCE -> GERMANY: Dear Germany,\n\nI fully agree with your point of making major moves during Fall, as well as the point of showing suspicion towards me. Once they realize how close we are - which is still the case in my opinion - they will team up against us.\n\nWith a juggernaut up to full speed now and Austria leaving his backdoor wide open to attack Italy, Russia will quickly become your main concern. If you can anticipate their move on you, that would definitely give you a clear advantage.\n\nThe question is what to do in the immediate future. I understand between the lines that you intend to attack Nwy in Fall, which would be succesful if you get England's help. The last two centers from England we can then take at a later stage.\n\nShould you have a different plan, where you need me, please let me know. All you say is in any event strictly confidential.\n\nSincerely,\nFrance\r\n3 FRANCE -> GERMANY: Dear Germany,\n\nTo tell you the truth, I like to discuss details and avoid misunderstandings. It is why I sent you my last messages and present message.\n\nIn terms of longtime strategy we have some time to work things out. In the immediate future, I take it that I don't need to support you anywhere. That is fine although I also want to add that, if you would move against me (given Bel is jeopardized and because you say you like surprise moves in fall:-)), I would not take that lightly and take the action required\n\nAs I mentioned before, I am also fine granting you Bel as long as we find the required northern balance, but would regret being forced to concede Bel.\n\nKind regards.\nFrance\r\n4 GERMANY -> FRANCE: France,\nThis game is complicated by the imminent defeat of Austria, who in recent reports is a annoyance to many of the other players. Including me. I am always a suspicious person. We have to be careful with the Juggernaut. That is a big concern for me. Getting attacked from all sides.\r\n5 FRANCE -> GERMANY: Hi Germany,\nAgreed. The jugg is a concern, as it always is when it gets up and rolling. The solo nature of the game will avoid them sticking together until the end, but perhaps still too long.\nI take it that implicitly you want to say I can rest assured that there won't be surprises anytime soon against me.\nAustria is annoying indeed and by going all in on an attack on Italy he is handing it to Russia and Turkey on a silver platter.\nLet's stick together and continue discussing. We can defeat them if we stick together.\nFrance\r\n6 GERMANY -> FRANCE: France\nSeconded and motion carried. The issue is that I need a base this turn if I attack Russia right now. The Sil Pru Quick attack.\nOtherwise I am a bit passive this turn.\nGermany\r\n7 FRANCE -> GERMANY: Hi Germany,\nThat is the quickest way and undoubtedly very important. It does not make much sense to do nothing with Nth though so I will expect a surprise there, which is fine by me, regardless of whether it is directed against England or Russia.\nAn option I'd consider in your place would be to ask England in Nwg to support you to Nwy or vice versa. England will likely want to take any possibility of surviving. Even getting you of Nth is huge already for him.\nThe downside for me is that I'd be a little more isolated against England but I think I can take him perhaps &with a little help from my friend&.\nI am signing off now. Good luck!\nFrance\nPs: I feel like you are a bit concerned I would be favorable to RT and therefore you are less inclined to trust me with specifics. That is definitely fine and understandable. But let me assure you I have no alliance whatsoever except with you. This is FG to the very end for what I am concerned. There is more to say for that scenario than to risk RT becoming too big too fail.\r\n8 FRANCE -> GERMANY: Pps: Given that you won't attack Bel, I have changed my purely defensive moves to trying to sneak into Lon. I have understood you don't want to go there and focus on Russia first and I won't try to convince you otherwise. But it seems best if at least one of us tries. So I will see whether England leaves Lon open and moves Lon-wal again. It wouldn't hurt either of us if England helped you take a dot from Russia while England loses two to me. If that happens, I'd be happy to help you into Edi next year and/or have Edi/Bel switch hands. Crucial for me is that we maintain a proper balance.\r\n9 FRANCE -> GERMANY: So I hope you will be at 7 after this year and same for me. Best case we are 8/7 almost controlling half of the board already. Good luck! Mic drop, France out.\r\n10 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Exciting!\r\n",

So we need to work to take him out. I'm moving to Gre from Ser with Russia's support. You could either support that move or tap and try to take Ion yourself. Both moves would be useful. The latter perhaps moreso than the first, since France may try to take Ion.\r\n6 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: im taking ionian. what if you moved back to budapest and let russia back into rumania and i got to keep bulgaria? right now we need to get italy out of the way so we can stop france and you are more useful than he is\r\n7 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: Sorry but... that's not going to happen.

But I'm trying.\r\n14 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: i mean you cant deny that my naval power is years ahead of russias or yours in terms of having any impact on france in the med. i think he will do the right thing\r\n15 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: I hope so.\r\n",

It behooves us BOTH to stop him in this game since we each only have two draws ourselves...because after all aren't we \"jostling for league position\"? ;)\r\n1 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: I propose a three way draw instead. :) you know if you kill me off, France will eventually overwhelm you. You need fleets. ~N~ ~N~ Let Russia concentrate on his northern front...if he doesn't, it will collapse and take you with it. ~N~ ~N~ You and Russia will split three Sc's two-ways...while England just grabbed two himself this very turn...and with about two or three more sure to come next year. ~N~ ~N~ think about it, at least...let us together fight France for the spoils of Italy. :)\r\n2 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: i will do... pretty concerned about France as you pointed out!!\r\n3 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: well how's THAT for luck?! We both missed last turn! We may be able to enter orders this turn with the full benefit of hindsight!! ~N~ ~N~ If EVER there were a golden opportunity to get Russia...NOW is the time! :) He nabbed at least 2 Sc's that last turn.\r\n4 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: did i miss something? i didn't see what Russia had done.\r\n5 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: He took Ank and Stp last turn.\r\n6 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: ah... entirely expected. (actually St Petes was not). So we going to submit moves?\r\n7 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: yes...what moves do you want to submit?\r\n8 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: I'm going to be pretty conservative this turn as don't want to get accussations of cheating. Will basically just be helping Italy out.\r\n9 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: Why not support me to Ionian?\r\n10 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: I think it would be better to prop up Italy, at least to I can get another fleet builtt. Otherwise France will claim Rome/Naples and it's a stalemate.\r\n11 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: propping Italy up will only seal your fate.\r\n12 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: Perhaps.... but I don't see how I can get at Rome/Naples before France does.\r\n13 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: well, then if you are willing to prop him up...why not prop ME up as well? You KNOW I can help. What say you?\r\n14 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: this being Autumn, Ank is lost...which will leave me with two Sc's. My disband will reflect your outlook. Two workable fleets in the Med would definitely put a stop to French advancement. ~N~ ~N~ You seem to have the power...you are deciding the fate of the game here.\r\n15 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: PLUS! seriously, when is the game of diplomacy EVER again going to allow you to make a move with the benefit of hindsight?! This is RARE. Let's use it...somehow. ~N~ ~N~ I'm going to move Aegean to Ion...support me if you'd like.\r\n",

I wish to take SER and would like for GAL to be vacant, that way should you decide to make a move on VIE (which should be empty) I will have the opportunity to retaliate against BUD.\r\n1 ITALY -> RUSSIA: I am not too sure what you should do in the North at the moment and I am not too sure about your choice of build either, obviously it is your call though, maybe i'm just jealous I had not builds last turn! That aside though you are most definitely going to start a war with France now as I am sure he will be none too please about 3 Russia fleets. That said it will hopefully keep him off my back so thanks!\r\n2 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Russia has told me that he will be moving BLA-CON to cover from my fleet in AEG. This would be a perfect opportunity to move GAL-RUM and RUM-BLA. What do you think?\r\n3 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Well it would be a great move if he actually plays those moves. And there is very good chance he will... or he might just decide to attack Rum. I'll keep this in mind.\r\n4 RUSSIA -> ITALY: I was out and about when I messaged you before. Thanks for the info. And it might be true, but it might be that Turkey wants you to think he will play Bla-con. And he probably will. But can't I can't committ to moving Rum-bla just yet. I have my psychic antennae up and I'll consult my tarot cards and tea leaves before putting my orders in just to be safe.\r\n5 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Which unit am I supporting to Ser. From your message I am guessing Tri-ser but Alb-ser is also worth considering.\nIf the former I understand why you would prefer me to not be in Gal. But I am a little bit worried about Rum. I could move gal-ukr perhaps, or as you suggest gal-rum, rum-BLA -which I admit would be the ideal move.\nLet's be clear though, which unit am [191844] to Ser?\r\n6 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Yes please support TRI-SER. I do not think you will have anything to worry about with RUM. If you are not going to use SEV doing anything else this turn that is. IF SEV S GAL-RUM while RUM -BLA there should be no problem with you keeping RUM, especially as I would be cutting any support from SER. The only way he could take it is if he moves in with SER, which would be very unlikely. Even if you were to somehow lose it I would give you full support to take it back.\r\n7 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Yes I see what you saying now... gal-rum supported by sev. Yes that makes a lot of sense. I'm a bit slow today. In that case Rum-bla makes a lot if sense.\r\n8 RUSSIA -> ITALY: typo... makes a lot &of sense\r\n9 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Okay. I think that is a winning plan.\r\n10 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Bud S Tri-ser, Gal-rum, Sev S Gal Rum, Rum-bla\r\n11 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Btw I realize that this fairly obvious... But I'll say it anyway... Please don't bounce Turkey in Con. I am really counting on getting the black sea.\r\n",

As GER I need to find a corner position, so I'm willing to look North/East - to Scandinavia and Russia. What do you think should be done, if we were to change course and avoid the coming war. I'm in a good position and exploring any options, plus, the fact is, I don't really want to end up between FRA and RUS, and FRA will be the one taking the most benefits if ENG falls.\r\n1 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: oh golly. hmmm well unless you attack france now im pretty much a goner. if you have 2 fleets next to north sea..... well the writing is on the wall. all i have left is a suicide option. who do i turn on and weaken? i am ok with anyone wining this game as long as they let me survive , usually i would be so downbeat about my chances but france at 4 fleets and no Italian front to worry about- you really should take Burgundy and really take advantage of the fact that he has a single army, the more i think baout i the sillier his deal with you looks, he can not save paris unless he uss mao to convoy to brest- a very unlilkley move considering he will probably focus on lvp and london\r\n2 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I agree with what you're saying about FRA. I was also amazed when he offered to disband his army. I actually think he'll convoy back.\n\nI would really like to take care of RUS, he's the only one who attacked me, and if he manages to hold AUS he'll be coming back. I also don't want to help FRA too much. He wants BEL back.\n\nIn short, I am interested in working with you, now I have a slight advantage, which is important, as ENG will always be better positioned for a stab.\n\nTell me what moves would you suggest, against FRA and RUS?\r\n3 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: move to burg? with the aim of paris or mars in autumn- i think he wont convoy back, that means him not taking eng channle this turn or NAO- both of which he would dearly love.\n\npic could move to bel, but that also means he wont retake eng channel and if kiel is in holland then bel can be retaken. if we are to have a partnership then i would like to regain a sc somewhere this year\r\n4 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I cannot move to BUR. I have to protect BER from MUN.\r\n5 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: move from belgium. IF i took bel then kile(holland) and burg could just kicke me out next turn. anyway if i took bel then you and france would just kill me. england cannot fight both fra and germany\r\n6 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Ok, the most important question for me is what are you going to do with NOR and NS. Can you move against RUS? If you do, I'll move on FRA next turn, with everything I've god. I need RUS off my back, this is the main reason I'm talking with you, so let's forget about BUR for the moment. Can you take St.p.?\r\n7 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: next turn yes\r\n8 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: not with your fleet in sweden but\r\n9 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: No, it needs to be this turn. I cannot move against FRA otherwise.\r\n10 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: keeping eng channel is my main priority,\n\nive got to go to work now sorry.\r\n11 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: can check from work in an hour or so\r\n12 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: If you wish, move NS-NOR also. This will make it sure that you take a center (St.p.) and a new build. I'll help you regain the NS and push FRA back. But you need to move on this turn. This is the best deal I can offer.\r\n13 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I will take st petes , i wont say no to a free sc just sitting there empty, especially in my dire situation, thats why you can trust me that i will take it. but if i do this turn you might just move sweden to norway- that would be game over for me\r\n14 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: sorry. north sea is busy. im at war with france, you can take advantage of his lack of land units now or face a france that controls most of england in 2 -3 years time\r\n15 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I am not going to move to NOR.

The chat was a hoot lol.\nWhat made you think I was reluctant?\r\n2 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Anyway I just realized Russia built only 1 army so he got only 2 fleets in the North.\nHe's also growing awefully big.\nIsn't it time to put aside enmity and/or misuderstandings?\nHe's gonna win the game so easily. There's a Juggernaut on the way, Austria is MIA, and he's taking advantage of our fighting (see what happened in Norway and he's gonna move in Norwegian sea if we don't fend him off)...\r\n3 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I need to go to bed now but I will definitely analyze and reply tomorrow.\r\n4 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: If you think I'm his ally, look at the map, the guy doesn't need me.\nI'm only good to him because I'm gathering western powers' attention.\r\n5 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: ok good night :)\r\n6 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: The fact that he built in Warsaw tells me you are not his close ally.\r\n7 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: With Austria MIA and a Juggie in the oven, you think he needs me?\r\n8 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: One upside is that turkey isn't a strong enough player to help with a jug and he also finally move to black sea. Okay off to bed for real. Lol\r\n9 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Also what is France doing, building only armies?\nDoes he think they can fly? lol ;)\nI'm worried your ally is a noob and I got lured by rumors.\nMaybe it's not too late for us, but it's gonna be tricky lol.\n\nThe one I don't understand the behaviour is Austria, I mean considering his early diplomacy and now he's not playing... Could we be facing a 2 accounts player?\r\n10 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Crazy idea #1:\n\nLet's pretend we fight:\nYou order Heli - Den (support from North Sea).\nI order Den - North and Kiel - Heli (in a desperate defense style).\nI believe with these orders you get Denmark anyway, no?\n\nThen I move to win Denmark back but you sneak in Sweden.\nYou get a build, I don't lose a unit and we don't appear to be friends ;)\n\n=> you get a 4th fleet to get control of Scandinavia and the north, I keep holding the french noob (supporting himself in Spain when there's no threat lol).\r\n11 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: ps about Turkey, I talked to him and he said it was a misorder. Fleet built in Smyrne not Con tends to prove this is true.\r\n12 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Update:\nI'm talking to Austria. We can still stop the Juggernaut. It may be too late soon if we hesitate.\nThe plan is to team up with Austria and Italy.\nItaly and I can fend off France and send units East to help you and Austria.\nWhat do you say?\r\n13 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I have figured it out. On mobile now will msg later don't finalize.\r\n14 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: [1535975].\r\n15 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Okay so will move to Ska and North and either I can support you to Sweden or vice versa. He can't double support it and I can cut support from Norway. The only downside is nothing will happen this season but I think that's okay.\r\n16 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I don't know.\nHe's gonna be in Norwegian Sea in spring and will threaten Edinburgh.\nYou may not be able to bounce Norway.\nWe need to come up with a good idea quickly...\r\n17 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: He's not going to Norwegian Sea. I told him I would retreat from it and not challenge Norway. Also, how can he threaten Edi when there's a fleet there? I am talking about moving out of Hel to North and move North to Ska and holding Edi. Surely there's some appeal there for you.\r\n18 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Oh I see, I didn't catch that. I thought Edi - North was the plan and you were remaining in Heli.\nAlthough to be honest I think he's gonna move in Norwegian.\n\nNow please understand the situation is a bit complicate for me.\nYour plan sounds good but I ain't gonna move against him first.\nI'm in the middle of the map and already under France's crazy pressure.\nIf I anger Russia I'm doomed.\n\nAll in all I stick to my offer:\nHeli moves in Den with support from North Sea.\nIf I play Den - North you get Denmark anyway, right?\n\nIt's spring. We'll see what we do next but I believe you'll be able to sneak in Sweden or maybe we'll come up with another idea depending on his spring moves.\n\nTo be honest, I prefer losing Denmark to you than angering him.\nWhat would you do in my stead?\r\n19 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: If you want to offer Denmark obviously I can use the build. If you move Denmark to North we would just bounce. If you are willing to lose Denmark then let me do the move to Ska and North but I won't support to North so you can bounce it. I'll then be in Hel and Ska and you can move freely to North next turn if you want it? You don't want to retreat to Baltic I assume?\r\n20 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Well if i move den- north and you move heli-den with support from north sea, denmark is yours in spring and i have to retreat but it may not be too bad actually.\nWould you please order heli-den with support from north sea?\r\n21 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Or maybe plan B:\nWe negociate a truce with Russia. He gets to keep Scandinavia and we get rid of France while he deals with the south.\nI can't play with France attacking me like mad and refusing to talk anyway...\nYou'd think I screweded his sister...\r\n22 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Instead of taking Denmark you let me support you in Belgium.\nWhat do you say?\r\n23 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Englandi-france is a poor alliance anyway, you want Germany to work with ;)\r\n24 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Another idea:\nWe negociate truce with the bear. He might be interested.\nYou support A Ruhr - Belgium.\nI give you Denmark in exchange ;)\nFair trade isn't it?\r\n25 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Okay you seem very sincere and like there are no more tricks. I will level with you but you need to keep it completely quiet okay?\r\n26 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Sure thing mate.\nHow do we proceed?\nyou support Ruhr - Belgium and then you take Den or you take Den and then support in Belgium?\nBecause we need to set our moves accordingly.\r\n27 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Okay -- here's the deal. I made an agreement with Russia that if I retreated we would be allies. Everything he has said since has indicated he is honoring that. He built in Warsaw because he wants to move on you. He wanted me to get in place to help attack you. Now you know.\n\nI'd be happy to trade Denmark for Belgium. I'll support you to Belgium from Ruhr. And then I am trusting you to give me Denmark in the fall. Maybe move Kiel to Berlin so that you can't support it and so that you'll have a place to retreat.\r\n28 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: ahah I had the feeling he wasn't needing me lol ;)\nAnd he probably was hoping you'd get busy with me so you'd be next.\n\nLet's pretend we're trading: your help against France for Denmark so he won't be offended by my move.\nI mean we won't have to tell him you told me what he has in mind ;)\n\nI set order A Ruhr - Belgium, Denmark is yours :)\r\n29 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Sounds good. He definitely does not like the non-action between England and France as he mentioned in the global early on, so I can frame it as instigating and manipulating.\r\n30 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I'm quite eager to know who's who in the end of the game, because I think Russia is really cunning when France sounds the opposite to me lol.\nDid you get to talk to France?\r\n31 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: The last I heard from France was 2 days ago when he told me I'd never make it to Hel so don't go for it. lol\r\n32 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: ps: I ain't moving my fleets for now but if you fear I won't honor my part of the bargain, you can move in Denmark first and I'll get Belgium in autumn.\nThe reason is I dealt with Russia not to move in Baltic, which means I can't go there on purpose (he may dislike it a lot), but I can retreat there ;)\r\n33 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: But to be honest I may prefer you take it in autumn so maybe I'll retreat in Sweden if he moves in Silesia or Prussia &wink& &wink&\r\n34 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: No I trust you. It is fine. It is better to make it look like we are friendly and then I'm stabbing you. Also, you'll be moving in reaction to Warsaw in Prussia or Silesia.\r\n35 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: True [1585733]\nAaaah, at last I have the feeling I've found the player I'll be able to build something with in this game ;)\r\n36 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: It was love at first sight. lol\r\n37 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: ahahahah!\r\n38 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: So just to change discussing ruling Europe, where are you from?\nUnless personnal chat is bothering you of course.\r\n39 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Boston! I take it you are from Europe based on some of your dialect, such as \"cheeky git\" which I have no idea what that means. lol\r\n40 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Ahah yeah I'm from Europe, France to be more precise.\nBut I got english friends using the word \"git\" a lot.\nIt's more friendly than offensive I take. Or at least I hope lol ;)\r\n41 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: But I couldn't really explain it to be honest lol\r\n42 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: So your English is perfect, huh? Impressive.\r\n43 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I had lots of opportunities to practice when I lived in Paris, hitting on tourist girls during my younger years ;)\nBut I first learned a lot during numerous trips in [273002], Norway (Scandinavian people speak english very well, much more than french ppl).\r\n44 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: My wife lived in Paris for a couple of years. She loved it obviously. I've never been there but I have been to Berlin a few times as my sister lives there.\n\nOh and of course I watch the Tour de France every year and love the aerial views of the countryside.\n\nHave you ever been to the US?\r\n45 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I heard a lot about Berlin, it's a city I've never been to but I'd love to have the opportunity.\nYes I've been to the US for one of my friends' wedding, in Houston, Texas, but I spent most of my trip in NYC at another friend's also invited to the wedding.\nI loved NYC but I couldn't adjust to Houston (way too big a scale for a frenchman).\r\n46 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: the Tour is awesome to watch, but to be honest I fancy the mountains parts of the race.\nWhat do you call the race of the day in english? we say \"_tape\" in french.\r\n47 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Yeah I love the mountain stages the best too. Have you ever gone out there in a crazy costume and chased them? lol\r\n48 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: lol never done that but I watched the race pass by once.\nWe got stupid: We went to a flat part of the city... They passed by so rapidly we saw nothing but a colorful blur lol ;)\r\n49 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Yeah I was thinking that the people in those parts don't see much. lol\r\n50 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: And you were right [1585733]\r\n51 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Well I'm off to bed mate.\nMy 5 years old is gonna wake me up early tomorrow morning so I better get some rest.\r\n52 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Thanks for the chat :)\nLet's talk soon ;)\r\n53 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Yeah I have a 5 and 3 year old (boys) -- I know what you mean.

If they had, Turkey would be in a hopeless position. Not sure why they opted for Rumania instead. Maybe Austria just wanted the SC.\n\nIf Russia supports you, Ruhr S Bur - Mun will be superfluous. The more I think about it, the more likely I am to take Stp, so there may be little point in feigning cooperation with Russia. If you do ultimately decide to support-hold Kiel from Ruhr, we can keep Russia from having builds to reinforce Germany with.\r\n1 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I mean feigning cooperation with Russia for more than one more phase, that is. Obviously it's to our benefit to go along this autumn.\r\n2 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: I think nor to st pt is a great move. Take lon to den supt by skag(might be cut) so maybe skag to den supt by nth. Might lose nor with sweed to nor. Just a thought. But I have no poblem denying Rus. I rebuffed him last turn but he got ber anyway. But yes, go for St pt. You could take den as well, but risk nor. Might get it thought. Worst case, rus loses and ger gets nor and you can retake. But we are on the same page. if you can get den, then you get Keil and then we take ber. Much fun.\r\n3 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: i'm still going to ask and hope for rus supt to mun. No reason not to use it.\r\n4 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: Just a note, fleets are heading at Italy. So is marsaille.\r\n5 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: Finalized already? Bold. ;-)\n\nYeah, I'm torn. I know F Nth S F Ska - Den may be the better move, but I really want to get my army off and doing something more useful than sitting around swilling ale in London. We'll see.\n\nNot a fan of the phase changing at 1am Eastern. Perhaps I should finalize too in the hope others will follow suit.\r\n6 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: I didn't mean to finalize. I'll undo that unless you think it will push the phase to earlier? i think den is better than sweeden. it would be good to get he army into den.\r\n7 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I doubt everyone else will finalize, so it probably doesn't matter.\r\n8 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: You know, it is possible we may pull this out without anyone noticing.\r\n9 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I suspect everyone will get the memo if your fleet in Channel vacates for the MAO and MAO hits the Western Med. Still, I think this move at least will contain a few surprises for everyone.\r\n10 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: Well, you never know. Still, I'm heading there. I wonder what Italy is planning?\r\n11 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: That is an excellent question. He's incredibly exposed to Austria, and not really in a good position against you either. He should be taking Turkish Scs as fast as possible to get himself some more builds for self-defense, but instead he's helping Austria against Russia. Does that make any sense to you? It doesn't to me.\r\n12 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I'll take it, it's to our benefit, but I don't know how it's to -his- benefit.\r\n13 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: I agree. Also, pulls Russia bacK.IF you lose it later, he loses germany to push on it.\r\n",

Austria is also 1 unit short as he could not build any in his home Sc's this turn. ~N~ ~N~ And Germany Turkey and England would have 19 Sc's in total. ~N~ ~N~ Let me know what you think?\r\n8 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Your move to Burgundy would be very Crazy.\r\n9 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: An alliance with Turkey would be wonderful... ~N~ But I do not trust him... ~N~ I help him on taking Moscow in order to he help me on taking St.petersburg from you... And instead he stab me in Warsaw... ~N~ But if you think we could trust him, lets go ahead!\r\n10 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Ok, I will post him. You are a good friend and will be my main ally and if he stabs you I will fight him.\r\n11 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: He is in a good spot to hit Austria, this may help him make up his mind.\r\n12 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Yes, I think you are right... Sorry my shorts messages, my english vocabulary is a bit short...\r\n13 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: That is ok your English is not so bad.\r\n14 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I have posted Turkey and pointed out that Austria is a easy target for him.\r\n15 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I think he will go for it.\r\n16 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: [578607] Neues Jahr!!! ~N~ ~N~ [543281] New Year!!! ~N~ ~N~ [146976] Ano Novo!!!\r\n17 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: We can talk more later. ~N~ I will let you know everything he tells me.\r\n18 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: [1168900] Neu Jahr.\r\n19 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: hello\r\n20 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: what about north sea support london to english channel?\r\n21 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Yes to the support to the Channel.\r\n22 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: The army at Munich support move to Ruhr from Holland. ~N~ The army at Warsaw support move to Moscow from St. Petersburg. ~N~ The army at Silesia support hold at Warsaw. ~N~ The fleet at Heligoland Bight move to Kiel . ~N~ The army at Prussia support hold at Warsaw. ~N~ The army at Holland move to Ruhr . ~N~ The fleet at North Sea support move to English Channel from London. ~N~ ~N~ What you say?\r\n23 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Yes sounds good. ~N~ I think the Turk will hit Warsaw hard, I could support Warsaw to Moscow. It is a crazy move?\r\n24 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Let wait on him to get back to us as well.\r\n25 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Hmmm\r\n26 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: If he attack Warsaw from Moscow, it will fail... ~N~ But, if he attack from elsewhere (Ukraine I suppose) it will works... ~N~ I think he will not let Moscow empty with an english army near...\r\n27 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Bel support Lon to Channel ~N~ London to Channel ~N~ Lvp hold ~N~ St.pete move or support you to Moscow ~N~ and Nor Sea to Edinburgh or North Atl?\r\n28 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Yes I think he will hit from Ukraine or Galicia.\r\n29 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: to Warsaw\r\n30 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I think Norwegian Sea to Clyde would be better... You could support Liverpool or retake [908702] from there...\r\n31 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I think he will attack Warsaw from Galicia, in order to move Rumania to Galicia...\r\n32 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: He posted me Ukraine to Warsaw, Galicia to Bohemia all others support. I don't know how much I would believe him though.\r\n33 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Well, I dont know... (about Warsaw)... You decide...\r\n34 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: If he joined us he could take Greece, and Tunis or Naples. I think this will be to much for him to resist.\r\n35 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: He has not logged on since I sent him the invite. Lets wait on his reply or at least for him to log on.\r\n36 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I think France will move Edinburgh to Lvp with Irish Sea support.\r\n37 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: How is [1592265]?\r\n38 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Ok, I am going to sleep... ~N~ I un-finalized my moves and will wait your post...\r\n39 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Ok we will talk later.\r\n40 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Hehehe, [1592265]? Nothing much different from [1451282]... My bank debts remains the same... :(\r\n41 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: 02:33 AM here\r\n42 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: see you...\r\n43 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: [419507] gehen\r\n44 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: He has not gotten back to me yet.\r\n45 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Turkey want an Alliance with us. Post him on what you 2 will do in the east. I have not agreed to giving any Sc's to him. But have agreed that he can win if he cleans up in the south.\r\n46 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: All right, I agree.\r\n47 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Ok, my St.pete will hold for this turn.\r\n48 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Does he want Warsaw?\r\n49 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: He is offline now... And I think he did not change his orders...\r\n50 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I propose to him leave actual front line as definitive and I would go back to attack France and he could attack Austria and Italy...\r\n51 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Please talk directly with him, I already said to him I will agree with you...\r\n52 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I told him he could take Budapest, Greece and Naples or Tunis.\r\n53 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I talked to him today and he wants to win. but it's our best chance to survive.\r\n54 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Are you holding in Warsaw or moving?\r\n55 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I will tell him to take Budapest instead of hitting Warsaw.\r\n56 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: All right! What you decide is ok for me...\r\n57 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: The army at Munich support move to Ruhr from Holland. ~N~ The army at Warsaw hold. ~N~ The army at Silesia support hold at Warsaw. ~N~ The fleet at Heligoland Bight move to Kiel . ~N~ The army at Prussia support hold at Warsaw. ~N~ The army at Holland move to Ruhr . ~N~ The fleet at North Sea support move to English Channel from London.\r\n58 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I have ~N~ Liverpool hold ~N~ London to Channel ~N~ Belgium support london to channel ~N~ St.pete to hold ~N~ Nor Sea to Edinburgh ~N~ ~N~ I'm off to work Talk to you tomorrow. ~N~ Here is my email [1046905]\r\n",

You should rather move Trieste to Adriatic, if You intend to turn on Turks at all (which You seem not to do).\r\n3 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: ok, next year i will stop that defensive attack. move to adr? leaves triest very open.\r\n4 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: You can effectively cover that with Serbia\r\n5 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: so, how shall it be then? will You proceed with Turks or re-consider Your position? It is obvious that I have to choose where I will be handing my Sc-s if I surely have to do that, so I would like to know, what are my options.\r\n6 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: sorry, what do you mean by ~N~ \"I have to choose where I will be handing my Sc-s\" ~N~ ?\r\n7 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I am wary of you copy and paste style flow of information to turkey:)\r\n8 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: With england probably stabbing France this year you will be able to kick out the Turkish raiders in the Ionian sea easily.\r\n9 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I have only copied some of the text to Turkey at the beginning of the game. But I'm not overly sure what did You meant with Your last comment. ~N~ ~N~ What I meant by my comment, was, that I'm pushed into the corner here - most probably I will not be able to defend all my Sc-s. I can be effectively defend only part of my Sc-s. This means that I have to make a choice, which Sc-s to defend and which to leave. Obviously, this will be either giving some powers advantage.\r\n10 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I am worried about France, he isn't a good tactical player so when england attacks it could be all over. I dont believe Turkey would try for a double draw with england, double draws are rightfully very rare. If germany is dead, russia soon too maybe? then that leaves you and me as the middle powers. I am mainly focused on securing a 4 way draw, its the first game of the league, i can afford to be more adventurous when it is the second game and i am not austria!\r\n11 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: So, as I understand from You, You are not very concerned about my existence & rather continuing the alliance with Turkey to achieve a 4-way draw? I don't think this is very reasonable choice, as I'm nearly 100% sure that English will stab French at one point (which You believe as well) & English have a pact with Turkey about the end-game. This will leave You out of the draw & provide 1st/2nd place to E/T which will give them the first points to access the final round. You are able to make far better than that (simply allying with Russia would give You the edge against Turkey & secure You a corner position instead of central position).\r\n12 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Iwill not move on Venice again. But using my fleet down in the sea will mean choosing between you and Turkey, something i am not willing to do right now.\r\n13 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: i dont believe turkey will aim for a [1410949] draw with england, too easy for england to go for the win, and being \"second\" is zero points as i understand it. it only comes into play when you are on equal points at the end of the 5 games and you have to compare SC gained as a tie breaker\r\n14 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Russia has already stated that he wants to reward turkeys \"sound\" game playing and penalize my \"unsound\" tactics as Austria. as i said to him regarding Turkey, why would i uselessly throw my units at Bulgaria when i have no chance of gaining it. i have \"let\" turkey get too big and the most logical way forward is to be secure and try for a draw.\r\n15 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I think it would be already sufficient if You wouldn't attack Venice anymore - then I might be able to bargain a deal with English that I could effectively stop Turkish further expansion.\r\n16 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: OK, i wont attack Venice again.\r\n",

This would of course destroy me and strengthen you and Italy but it would leave you with me as an enemy and with a fore more experienced player as Italy. I have never seen an [1130702] alliance work well. Also, this kind of high profile players like [459981] will just try to use you for everything they want and then stab you.\nYour other choice would be of course to stick with me and go for even a 2 way draw (these games always end in 3-4way draws so a [1410949] draw is a big success for both of us). I am someone who you already know you can trust. Also Juggernauts kick asses!\nLet me know if you have another plan proposal!\r\n7 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: My plan suggests that we both attack Italy in Autumn so that at least one of us has success.\r\n8 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: ps: If you feel unsafe about a strong Russia I can accept that you always keep a fleet in bls. This can make you feel really safe and would always be a kind of control over me. I don't mind if you decide that.\r\n9 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: ok. i agree with your plan, and i'll move black sea to con, smy hold this spring. and rum will support hold bud.\ni feel that i can trust you, so i don't need a fleet in black sea anymore now that austria's gone. and you're already being extremely generous by letting me keep rum. a 2 way draw sounds great...i've never been in one of these tourneys, so if i survive till the end, whether i win, draw or lose, i'll feel good. :)\r\n10 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: great man! thx\nI don't feel I'm being generous with Rumania... :P\r\n",

I'm already in burg. Come join me. Give me some meaning in this game and let me provide you a tactical advantage.\r\n2 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Your fleet build wasn't just to play against me. Let's get a jump on your next objective.\r\n3 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: OK, I like your idea. I'm a bit rushed at the moment, but how would you like to use Burgundy? I can provide plenty of support for your hold if you want to support Piedmont into Marseilles, but I'll have to find out what France wants to do before we can make solid plans. Luckily, we have some time. I'll be in touch, and look forward to hearing from you.\r\n4 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Hello again, I've found a moment. Are you on good terms with Italy? Do you think he will help you make gains in France? We'll need him to make a difference.\r\n5 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Yes he will. He's the one that really urged me to keep Burgundy.\r\n6 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I have asked Italy to support you into Marseilles. That is one of the easiest things that can be done right now, and France will have a hard time recovering Marseilles. Let me know if you can confirm that with him.\r\n7 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: France will hold Marseilles. What makes you think he won't hold it?\r\n8 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I'm more concerned about the fleets (mine and yours) and if you're going to move to Picardy and/or EC?\r\n9 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Because he wants to force the disband.\r\n10 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I'm not moving to ENG, so it's all yours. A supported move to ENG is very likely to succeed. I'm not moving to Picardy.\r\n11 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Do you have information to the contrary?\r\n12 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I have 2 proposals, and I'm not really sure who to trust between you guys. Probably neither. You both have played me like a fiddle since the beginning.\r\n13 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I see. I've only given you good information, and you've offered me a promising proposal, in which I am very interested. I think we've got the means to handle him, the support from Italy, and clear paths of expansion. I imagine that an agreement between England and France would require fighting both Italy and Germany--and possibly Russia as well. Do you think that is a sustainable path to success--or at least being included in a draw?\n\nPerhaps I should offer you my own proposal, which builds upon the cooperation we've garnered from Italy and our current position. Italy supports you into Burgundy; it's simple, it doesn't rely on my co-operation and it's likely to succeed. I can move into Burgundy unsupported, offering support for your hold, ensuring that you keep Marseilles--but not displacing or forcing your disband in case Bur-mar doesn't work. I can offer an immediate ceasefire in the northern seas, ensuring that NTH is vacant unless you occupy it, and I can prevent--forcefully, if necessarY--RUSSIA from harassing your backside. Peace with you means I can focus on others who are more threatening--continuing to attack you means over-committing to the north which will only benefit France and Austria. This is why I want to work with you. I'm not convinced why France would be so keen--does he have a path to expand except through Italy, me, or you?\r\n14 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: So please consider working with me and Italy instead of France. I think you'll find it much more lucrative.\r\n15 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I hear your offer, but my mind keeps running back to where you said:\n\n\"Because he wants to force the disband.\"\n\nCan you explain this strategy and why he would attempt this? It just doesn't make sense to me.\r\n16 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: If we can disband your army, we can focus north. You're in a sensitive area now, threatening Paris and Marseilles--at least theoretically. Since you also threaten Munich and Belgium, it makes sense that I would not want you in Burgundy either.\r\n17 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Further, simply pushing you out of Burgundy would allow you to retreat to an open territory--such as Gascony, where you could then threaten Brest, Spain and Marseilles. This is why a disband is especially important to the Frenchman, and not so critical to me.\r\n18 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: This makes sense, right? I hope I'm not talking like a crazy person after a long day at work.\r\n19 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: It makes sense. I don't understand how you can move to force me to disband. Bounce in Gascony, bounce in Picardy, and you attack Burg with support?\r\n20 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Bre - Pic, Par - Gas, Bre - Gas, Mar-bur (with my support), Gol - Mar. This is why I suggest Pie S Bur to Mar.\r\n21 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: sorry\n\nENG - Pic, Bre - Gas&\r\n22 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Ah, Now it makes sense. I could waltz into EC then and set up to take MAO if I were aggressive and could trust you not to take Nths.\r\n23 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Yes, exactly. I have no interest in NTH; I would rather focus elsewhere.\r\n24 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: So, it's almost decision time. Will you attempt Marseilles? Do you have any other suggestions or requests regarding moves?\r\n25 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: You there?\r\n26 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Well, good luck England. I guess we'll see.\r\n",

I'll need help if Italy turns on me this turn, which I'd say there is a decent possibility of that happening. If you wanted to preemptively move to Tyrolia I certainly wouldn't be opposed.

Sevastopol is assured, Rumania, far from it, but it is better to get you out of Serbia, but attacking Rumania will likely fail, so lets attack Budapest from Serbia. like this:\n\nArmenia to Sevastopol with support from Black,\nBulgaria to Rumania\n\nthe above takes Sevastopol 100%\n\nThen Serbia to Budapest with support from Trieste, Vienna will cut gal. You get Budapest, and this gets you out of Serbia.\r\n1 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: Looks like a solid way forward to me. As you can imagine Aegean will be defending Greece so unable to provide interference with the Italian navy (Italy is extremely upset with me about that, so I trust my assistance defending Naples was appreciated ;) ). It looks like you have things under control there anyway.\r\n2 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: Orders confirmed entered as discussed.\r\n3 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: I can obviously hold Rome and Naples without any problems.\r\n4 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: and yes, that cut last turn was quite helpful, thank you.\r\n5 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: you know, they is an alternative way to attack that might be better. I was just looking at the map a bit more.\r\n6 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: Serbia - Rumania with support from Bulgaria\nArmenia to Sevastopol with support from Black.\n\nI have to cut both Budapest and Gal and you get Rumania (and move out of Serbia)\n\nThis puts you into Rumania, instead of Budapest, which is better long term for fighting fronts. I will likely lose Vienna, but keep Serbia, but gain Rome, so it's fine.\r\n7 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: oh, except, he will see this coming and perhaps move Budapest to Serbia, hmm...\r\n8 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: okay, not interested in discussing? That means two builds for Turkey and they will both come from you, not from me. and the destruction of Russian south navy as well. I just do not understand your constant game long desire to attack Austria instead of Turkey.\r\n9 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: I have a sneaky suspicion that you may have sent that last message to the wrong address :p\r\n10 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: We continue with the original plan, by the way. I'll delay taking the piss until tomorrow ;).\n\nOh, and I guess I should probably mention that if you do switch sides to the purple muppet I will have no choice but turn all guns against you and allow Russia to expand freely into Turkey. So don't do that :p.\r\n11 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: oh yes, that's true, I have been writing Russia for the ENTIRE game, and he never seems to want much to do with me, oh well.\r\n12 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: I am not going I am just trying to get him to move out of Budapest!\r\n13 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: to switch sides I meant, just trying to encourage him to make a move that might let me keep Vienna and get him out of Budapest.\r\n14 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: Lol!\n\nSurprisingly enough, I believe you.\n\nBut I fully intend to remind you of this cock-up at every opportunity for the remainder of the game :p\r\n15 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: Russia has been a real douche the entire game, he broke a DMZ in spring 1901, then took Rumania the other way around, even while you were attacking him, then refused to move out, etc. He's just a dick. He has ZERO chance to win by attacking me, because his southern navy is about to die, forever, I might add, and even if he gets all of Austrian territory, he can never take me out of Italy, because the top of the boot can be defended, pretty much forever, seeing as he has no southern navy anymore. I don't give a shit when people attack me, but it annoys me to no end when people play irrationally against their own interests.\r\n16 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: Like what Italy did. He attacked me, and then he died. Had he not attacked me, he would not have died. Irrational move on his part.\r\n17 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: Actual diplomacy players do tings that advance their own interests, so when people don't do that, it annoys the fuck out of me.\r\n18 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: things\r\n19 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: by the way, your suggestion that you would give all of your SC to Russia is ludicrous, in that, it's not necessary. You have a 100% certain way this turn, to kill his southern navy, forever. And there after, even if EVERYONE on the map attacked you, which isn't going to happen, you could hold up by blocking Armenia and with your other stuff, you can never be defeated and very likely never ever be scaled back, so after you kill fleet Sevastopol, you are pretty much immortal, no matter what happens in the game, unless France or Germany solo.\r\n20 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: You could at least do me the courtesy of pretending to take my threats seriously :p\r\n21 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: oh shit! sorry! Please don't throw the game to Russia!! OMG NOOOOOOO! Anything but that!\r\n22 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: That's better... I think...\n\nSo, how are you finding our other chums now you've had time to get to know them?\r\n23 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: Italy just adores me!\r\n24 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: Germany and France barely speak to me, I guess I am too salty for gentle communications.\r\n25 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: although, realistically, with Germany and Russia joined at the hip, with no sign of this stopping, the only strong way forward is France/Austria/Turkey together.\r\n26 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: I would say a German or Russia stab on the other considering that Germany just attacked France and you just attacked Russia, as out of the question, which means we need to beat Russia's butt to contribute to the anti R/G coalition.\r\n27 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: I am pretty sure that Gal will be supporting Rumania to hold. Bohemia will hit Vienna. Budapest will either support himself to hold or move or hit Serbia or Trieste.\r\n28 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: There is a miserable new trend for people to treat the game as a series of polite conversations of the sort you find in pointless office meetings. If I wanted that I'd just stay longer at work. Oh for the good old days when face to face diplomacy was about getting drunk and shouting at the twat next to you, then laughing about it with another beer afterwards!\n\nWe've gone from the atmosphere of a [657674] feasting hall to a civil service team building event, and I ain't best pleased.\n\nBut yes, hit Russia hard, and when he's on the back foot take the opportunity to start worrying Germany so France has some breathing space.\n\nOnce allied victory is assured France will no doubt try to turn us against each other and, being somewhat full of himself, he will be 100% confident of success. That's when we kill him :)\r\n29 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: let's confirm exact moves for this turn, so we are certain not to muck it up.\n\nI have told Russia that he needs to propose a super friendly Austrian move, but he has not, and will not. What I wanted him to do, was to move out, but his answer was \"I will support you into Serbia\" to which i resoundingly said no thanks.\n\nSo this is what I expect him to do, with my level of confidence in each.\n\nBohemia - Vienna (100%)\nGal supports Rumania (80%)\nwith Rumania supports something, does not matter.\nSevastopol, does not matter what it does\n\nBudapest??? I have told him that I am supporting Vienna to hold, and that I do NOT want to go to Serbia, so with Budapest, I would expect him to support himself to Vienna, or perhaps go to Serbia or Trieste? Not sure\r\n30 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: Right now, you are going to Budapest with my support, and I am cutting Gal, but perhaps it is better for us to go like this:\n\nSerbia to Rumania with support from Bulgaria\nArmenia to Sevastopol with support from Black Sea.\n\nThen I could cut both Galicia and Budapest and you get both Sevastopol and Rumania, and quite possible Serbia will be left open, although I will not have anyplace to build on.\n\nI have to leave for rehearsal in 20 minutes, so I do not have a lot of time.\r\n31 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: Very well. Let's do it. Confirm you've received the message and I'll enter those orders\r\n32 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: got it\r\n33 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: Excellent. It is done.\n\nWhat are you rehearsing?\r\n34 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: HMS pinafore\r\n35 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: Oh we sail the ocean blue and our saucy ship's a beauty!!\r\n36 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: We are sober men and true and attentive to our duty!!\r\n37 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: One I've never, never gone to see\r\n38 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: Are you kidding me? It's amazing\r\n39 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: I did fantasticks last month\r\n40 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: I was one of the goofy dads\r\n41 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: One of the most amazing things about HMS pinafore, is that it was written in [1420017], and it's amazing today still\r\n42 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: Damn it man, you just missed your cue for a \"What, never?\" :p\r\n43 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: Oh shit, I was driving.\r\n44 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: You're forgiven :).\n\nOf course, Princess Ida would be perhaps more appropriate...\n\nOh, Hungary!\nOh, Hungary!\nOh, doughty sons of Hungary!\nMay all success\nAttend and bless\nYour warlike ironmongery!\r\n",

I hope you had fun at the cottage. My canoe trip was great. I think you should keep your fleet in Barents sea to support your hold of St Petersburg. I think your other fleets should be used to convoy an army to Norway (ie. after you next build) so that you can help with the land battle against [957554]. That could be your fleet in North Sea. I'm not sure what to suggest for your fleet in Norwegian Sea. Perhaps discuss with Sean what he plans to do with his fleet in NAO? I think he should move that one south to MAO to help him in the mediterranean. Then you could move NAO...\r\n3 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: PS. I am going to move from Sweden to Finland, and from SKA to Sweden. My biggest worry right now is that if Jess moves her fleet from Both to Baltic Sea, then suddenly she threatnes Berlin, Kiel, Denmark and Sweden!

        "intent_dialogue": "0 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: Your moves are all fine and dandy, but at some point, stacking all your armies next to me, and taking my centers, does kinda make me think that maybe you're out to get me. If you're going to move armies south, I must ask you to build a fleet in stp this year. A new army in mos says that you're heading for me, and I will have to respond accordingly. As I've mentioned earlier, I can't fight you, Italy, and Turkey all at once, and if it comes down to it, I won't: I'll just fight you.\n\nAs for the Italians: however clever they may be, they're not the ones who took rum. Now, if you're willing to listen, I have an idea. The attack on Turkey isn't going anywhere until I have a fleet in aeg or he lets you into bla/arm. In the meantime, we have a lot of armies, and we don't need all of them to keep the Turks bottled up. We can keep stacking them on our border, which benefits pretty much everybody but us, or we can move them west, towards Germany. It makes sense: you've already upset him by helping England, so you wouldn't be burning any bridges. I assume one of you will take den this turn, so Germany will be in no position to retaliate. If you build in stp/sc and then move to pru/sil and bal in the spring, you'll have a very good shot at taking ber and crossing the stalemate line, especially with the English fleet in den to cut support. You'll grow much faster that way than by coming after me, especially as I've already stated that I would rather let anybody but you have my centers (I feel like I've said that a lot of times).\r\n1 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I find the whole tactic of saying 'do what I say or I will only attack you and only you' to be a sign of desperation and ineffective, it's definitely not something that would motivate me to act in anyway differently and certainly implies that you are starting to feel the pressure that you feel the need to feel the need to have such 'threatening' undertones in your press to me. All it does is undermine the good points that you made in your press, now i'm thinking should I leave my borders open to someone who has blatantly threatened me like this?\nYou should really know that Italy is the one for you to watch now and know also that he has been talking to me about moving East, something which I have discouraged. So if you are going to be giving threats he might be your next port of call. I will be moving WAR-GAL to protect my interests next turn, other than that you can expect no aggressive play from me. MOS-UKR will facilitate holding onto RUM while also leaving SEV free to offer/take support for BLA. How you would propose a move and Germany and why are you turning so quickly on your friend?\r\n2 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I am only informing you of what I will do if given no other choice. For the obvious reasons, I really don't want to fight you, as that's a fight I don't see myself winning. What I'm trying to do then, is offer you two alternatives that I believe would be more profitable for you: Germany and Turkey.\n\nAs for war-gal, mos-ukr . . . that's not very aggressive. It is what follows that worries me. If you would agree to (and actually) build in the north this turn, I would be much less worried about your intentions.\r\n3 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: Yes I will be building in the north this turn as you never know when England is going to finish off the French so I need to be ready for that.\r\n4 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: Thank you very much. The chance of England sneaking into both par and por petrifies the Italians!\r\n5 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I don't think it does as he is trying to convince him to stab France...?\r\n6 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: He wants England to stab France somewhat unsuccessfully!\r\n7 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: What is that supposed to mean, surely England would have to do something drastically stupid to be unable to walk into empty Scs?\r\n8 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: He wants France to defend them, of course!\r\n9 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: well if that is his plan then we should have no problem in taking him out because England and France are pretty tight at the moment, that will change in the future, but right now they need each other. If we go with the plan of leaving our borders empty then I would suggest you move on Italy and I take on Germany as Italy will be in stalemate for a few more years to come.\r\n10 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: That is a good plan. I can't get out of gal while you tap it, but we can move out in the spring?\r\n11 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: Yes I mean in Spring as we have not laid down anything concrete as of yet for our movement westwards.\r\n12 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: That sounds like a good plan. And in the meantime, we agree not to let Turkey out of the box?\r\n13 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I promise not to support any of his moves, but that does not mean that I intend to support hold any of your units either :P\r\n",

Would you prefer if I pushed the issue a bit more or would having him in AEG not be inconvenient for you?WILL you have a unit to bounce him?\r\n1 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: Any word for Italy this turn?\r\n2 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: Sorry I don't quite understand . . . what does Turkey want to do? And what were you hoping to do in response?\r\n3 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: Sorry for the curtness there. I'd just woken up and was running late and couldn't get your press to make any sense.\n\nIs this what you meant?\nTurkey: bla-con, con-aeg, arm-ank/smy\nRussia: sev-bla, ukr-sev\nAustria: bul h (letting Turkey into aeg so you can take bla)\n\nIf that's the case, you could also try talking him into con-smy, bla-aeg on the premise that I'd bounce him out of aeg, whereas he could move to smy and con and then support himself to aeg in the fall.\r\n4 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: Sorry if I was not clear, he is hoping to move CON-AEG, BLA-RUM (with support from me) and ARM-SMY/ANK, I am not sure about the last move, but it should be irrelevant anyway. So with that in mind I am hoping that I can move to the Black sea in the Spring. This will mean that if BLA is actually going to make it to RUM in the Spring then you will only be able to hold it with GAL otherwise I will not have enough support to get him in and SEV will bounce with BLA and it will be a bit of a waste. Do you think that will be possible? It still means me taking RUM in the Fall with UKR but also allows me to have BLA in Spring, the only complication that there could be is his move to AEG, you will need to have a unit in place in order to counter that movement. Is that better? :)\r\n5 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: That is much better. So I should let you support the Turks into rum, let the Turks into aeg, and slip into con? In the fall, you take rum from the Turks, I keep con or retreat to ank/smy, the Turkish fleet goes away, and we get ready for Thanksgiving?\r\n6 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: Well if it all works out then it would be nice to chill after some hard diplomatic work!\r\n7 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: Let me know how it all goes . . . for now, are we assuming the Turks are moving con-aeg, bla-rum?\r\n8 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: Yes, he has approved of the move and implied it but no outright confirmation as of yet and I do not want to push it much as that might make it seem fishy, however he does know/think that UKR and SEV are supporting him to RUM this Spring.\r\n9 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: Alright, I will move accordingly. And if I don't take con, you will help me retake rum in the fall?\r\n10 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I will.\r\n",

        "intent_dialogue": "0 ITALY -> TURKEY: That's fair enough. Leave it to those clowns hopelessly fighting France to resort to smearing my good name just because I didn't join them. Sour grapes.\n\nI was actually expecting to get Serbia and Budapest, but it's not a problem, we'll just work from here. I'll shuffle around and get Budapest (your support would be much obliged on that front) and slide fleets west now that a convoy isn't necessary. You grab Sevastopol and Serbia and we'll be on our way.\r\n1 TURKEY -> ITALY: Mhmm. They've spent most of the game smearing both you and interestingly Russia.\n\nOkay I'll see if I can't support you and hit Rum. It seems like a solid plan.\r\n2 TURKEY -> ITALY: Actually I might just send Bulg to Greece and support Tri to Bud with serbia. Would that be alright with you?\r\n3 ITALY -> TURKEY: England and Germany are funny. I actually asked both of them about going west against France right off... both of 'em turned me down then waited until I had a fleet in the Adriatic and one army a year's distance from Marseilles before asking if I wanted to attack France. Not sure what their deal is about Russia, I'm sure they're just trying to get someone to keep him busy now that Austria's gone... and like I said, sour grapes, man.\n\nGreat, thanks! If you can do those then Russia loses Budapest and Sevastopol.\r\n4 TURKEY -> ITALY: That does sound pretty funny. I haven't been able to work out anything England sent to me. Total gibberish, and germay at the moment just wants to grow. xD\n\nYeah.. he should.\r\n5 TURKEY -> ITALY: Now maybe it's a bad idea to believe anything a power like Austria is saying at the moment but.. he mentioned that you've been considering an attack on me with Russia. Do you think those are just recycled rumours placed there by Germany and England? Or him trying to screw me over?\r\n6 ITALY -> TURKEY: Austria explicitly requested that Russia and I keep him alive (in Serbia, etc.) until you died. I told him I would comply. I then promptly attacked Russia, cutting the support which was keeping Austria alive. I hope that is testament enough to my loyalties.\n\nHmm... maybe you could send me some of what England's saying, then? I could follow him alright. If there's something sensitive there then don't worry about it, of course, but I'll take a crack at it if need be.\r\n7 TURKEY -> ITALY: He told me stuff like Germany will be taking Kiel? Here is the message in full: I have some useful information for you. as promised, Russia and France are suspected and most likely in plan with each other. in the north and I believe they intend to take this game all together. Austria germany and I being in the middle of the board have found a possible plan of attack that could cripple their ability to do so. If you take rumania from serbia, you can work north allowing austria to try and handle the italian so you aren't in essence, picking up scraps. If we do not alter the course of this game, Russia will stab you for his much bigger ally france after you cross greece. if you want, you could even take rumania from con with bulgarian and greece support. I have a plan to take the north but will need you assistance in the south to make the attack effective. Germany will be taking kiel to put pressure on his north as will I.\r\n8 TURKEY -> ITALY: That would make sense then. Guess he's just holding onto a dated idea and hoping he screws up.\r\n9 TURKEY -> ITALY: &he screws me up\r\n10 ITALY -> TURKEY: Huh. As far as that message goes, all I can see from this is that he wanted you to bother Russia in [592713] instead of attacking Serbia so the four of us eastern powers (adding Austria back in) get stuck and mired in stalemate. Meanwhile his EG alliance tears through France and a weakened northern Russia.\n\nBasically he wanted you to be the distraction while he grabbed the spoils. Real swell guy.\n\nAs for Austria, I suppose so. I'd also attribute any such rumor-spreading now to a dying man looking to stir up trouble. Did he say from where he heard the Italy-russia alliance rumor?\r\n11 TURKEY -> ITALY: Yeah I figured some of it. In the end I just gave up told him I didn't really understand what he wanted, and he never bothered to message me again. >.<\n\nNope. I could ask him I suppose.\r\n12 ITALY -> TURKEY: lol. I sent a rather icy reply to the request to attack France, made nice afterwards. Haven't heard back, don't expect to hear back until he needs something else, don't expect to accept whatever request he might make.\n\nThat might be nice. If it's from me, I hope my actions spoke to themselves to show I was lying to him. If it's Russia, that would be interesting insight into Russian intentions.\r\n13 TURKEY -> ITALY: Russia made his intentions rather clear to me a while back when he told me that moving to arm was a mistake.\r\n14 ITALY -> TURKEY: Yikes. Sounds intimidating. Well, guess he overplayed his hand...\r\n15 TURKEY -> ITALY: Sorry I think I jumbled the message. He was talking about his move to Arm being a mistake. And apologizing for it. You can see how that went for him.\r\n16 ITALY -> TURKEY: Oh, gotcha. Yeah... huh. Strange.\r\n17 TURKEY -> ITALY: Why he said something different to you?\r\n18 ITALY -> TURKEY: He told me it was intentional when I asked him about it. &shrug&\r\n19 TURKEY -> ITALY: Mhmm. naturally. I'm sure we're all lying to one another in some way. :P\r\n20 ITALY -> TURKEY: =P\r\n21 TURKEY -> ITALY: Man I'll be honest with you. I'm still struggling with what to do this turn. Like really struggling. .. Ugh.\r\n22 ITALY -> TURKEY: ...?\n\nArm -> Sev w/BLA support, Bul -> Rum with Ser supporting either that last move or Tri -> Bud... that should do it, right?\r\n23 TURKEY -> ITALY: Yeah it makes sense when it's all straight out like that... then there are stuff that's gone down with Russia, and copies of messages he's forwarded to me. (Don't tell him I mentioned him doing so. I'll deny it vehemently. Based on the moves he told me you're making. I should be moving Serb to Greece with support Bulgaria, to bounce you and keep Serb and trying to get fleets to the med. ) The problem is the contradictions between what you're tell me and what he's telling me you're telling him are so vast I'm unsure what the board could even look like next turn.\n\nIt's late I'm tired and frustrated I've been trying to decide what to do for nearly 24 hours now, deadline is looming and I still have no real orders in.\r\n24 ITALY -> TURKEY: What did he tell you he was going to do [180495]?\r\n25 TURKEY -> ITALY: Nothing so blatant naturally. More just the hints of what he's going to try\r\n26 ITALY -> TURKEY: Can you please tell me what he was hinting at?\r\n27 TURKEY -> ITALY: I suppose. He mentioned that he may try for Vie. It all depends on how much he trusts me of course though.\r\n28 ITALY -> TURKEY: Well, then. No use in siding with a traitor. And to think I was about to trust him... shows me good.\n\nLet's rip his heart out from under him. I'm ordering Tyl -> Boh, Tri -> Bud, Vie supporting, with Alb -> Tri behind it. ION is going to TYS, ADR to ION.\r\n29 TURKEY -> ITALY: Aren't you glad we had this talk ;)... sorry I'm so out of it right now. I think this will be a pivotal point in the game. Mhmm, well you did lose a lot with him my hitting bud. I'm probably going to lose even more of his respect or what have you if I go turncoat now.\n\nSorry I'm tired and babbling. Chances are I won't remember half of this conversation by morning.\n\nBasically if we stick together and keep communication up we'll go far. Really though me you and him are all traitors. You betrayed him. He was about to betray you and now I guess my turn must be coming up.\r\n30 TURKEY -> ITALY: Well I need sleep. I hope tomorrow I'll see you've kept your world and purple is disintegrating.\r\n31 ITALY -> TURKEY: Sure am. I really appreciate it. It stands to reason that I lost some favor with him over Budapest, but I definitely feel like what he did this diplomatic phase is an extreme overreaction because we discussed the issues he had this phase and I explained myself in what I thought was a reasonable, forgivable (if only just) action. And it sure seemed as though we had come to an agreement. Such is life.\n\nAnd yes, ultimately, I'm as much a traitor as he is. I'm glad I was given the chance to see the truly honest one in time.\r\n32 ITALY -> TURKEY: Good night. Your hopes are well-placed.\r\n33 TURKEY -> ITALY: I definitely appreciate it too. I've really enjoyed working with you thus far and would be happy to continue. Mhmm I read what you sent him about Budapest. It was a well argued case. However I think Russia is one of those players who once you betray his trust he just goes all out against you darn the consequences. He told me that he knew he wasn't likely to get anything besides Vie working with me but he's still rather be working with me then you. Don't you love how two faced dippers are?\n\nYeah well truly honest at the moment. ;) we all lie during this game at some point. All betray someone. If we didn't it would be a very different game.\n\nOkay sleep time for real now. Night.\r\n34 ITALY -> TURKEY: My goodness, he really did send you everything. I think your assessment is absolutely correct, that just seems plain irrational. I guess telling him he was being overly emotional and overreacting pushed his buttons a bit too. Frankly, in some senses it is a shame... there was a golden opportunity, literally and figuratively, awaiting us. I can't say I blame him, though, I would be hesitant to jump on board as well. But leaking everything like that... hm.\n\nTruth is treason in the empire of lies.\n\nBona nocte.\r\n",

Germany has asked me to support him by attacking you in the North Sea, but I put him off by discussing a troop rotation ... putting a F in SWE to support him in DEN next year. (of course, it could just as easily support you. I told him I wanted to move my A FIN->Norway so I can convoy to Scotland.\r\n1 ENGLAND -> RUSSIA: That is an excellent answer. He called me a \"cheeky git\" for my move to Hel. Whatever that means. lol\r\n2 RUSSIA -> ENGLAND: He can still cut support if he guesses right though. If you order HEL->DEN he could end up with F KIE->HEL and take it right back. And if you order NTH->DEN the same move cuts support. Similar situation exists with HOL. We could get tricky, though, and you could order F NTH->SKA and I could support your F EDI->NTH from NWY. I think that would catch him by surprise!\r\n3 RUSSIA -> ENGLAND: (Of course, I would not be able to order A FIN->NWY ... too bad. :)\r\n4 RUSSIA -> ENGLAND: I am thinking too much. If he does guess right on that last set of moves, he could order F KIE->HEL w/support from DEN and destroy your fleet. :(\r\n5 ENGLAND -> RUSSIA: Yeah I really need to give it a good look tonight. I'm at work. I had assumed Ska was off limits but you have my utmost assurances I am done attacking you and consider you my strongest ally on the board.\r\n6 RUSSIA -> ENGLAND: Just keep telling Tutkey we are at odds. He talks to Germany.\r\n7 ENGLAND -> RUSSIA: I have figured it out. On mobile will msg later don't finalize.\r\n8 RUSSIA -> ENGLAND: OK\r\n9 ENGLAND -> RUSSIA: Okay -- I have told Germany that I am moving to Ska and North Sea so that I can support him to Sweden or vice versa. In reality, i will take Denmark (or you will, but I need a build more right now I think).\n\nSo make sure you get a guy to Sweden this turn so you can move in or help support in. If I get the build I'll then go to the channel and start hitting France.\n\nGermany has been BEGGING me to help him against you (I am NOT).\r\n10 RUSSIA -> ENGLAND: Good. I am on my mobile between planes (transatlantic) but do plan to cover Sweden. Will respond later if possible.\r\n11 ENGLAND -> RUSSIA: Wow have a good flight! You are dedicated.\n\nNo one knows you and I are friendly so that is &great&.\r\n12 RUSSIA -> ENGLAND: Agreed. And when Germany figures it out it will be a bit late.\r\n13 ENGLAND -> RUSSIA: Okay -- I have successfully gotten this done. Germany thinks I am backing off and am friends with him now. I am supporting him to Belgium to get that stalemate going a bit. Then in the fall I will snag Denmark from him.\n\nHow was your flight?\r\n",

Russia was in a position where he could only build in a manner that could be considered against either you (A War) or Turkey (A Mos). I am guessing you will have exchanged press and that he will have tried to explain A War as focusing on attacking Austria? If so, how did he react to events in the west unfolding?\n\nI think it is now important to keep Austria on our side to turn this into [69142] vs RT in first instance. I feel we should be able to do that. After all, we did not invade his country.\n\nIn terms of moves, the main question I had is whether you would be up for Mun-bur and Bel-bur to bounce? I know that leaves me more vulnerable in Bel, but I don't want to risk seeing an army in Bur all of a sudden. Even the slightest risk of that happening I would like to avoid, and I don't see what other use we can put our armies to.\n\nMy other units (apart from Mar aned Po) will perhaps proceed south more slowly than I announced during builds phase to assure we can finish England this year, and start our midgame plan this, or at the latest next year.\n\nHappy to hear your thoughts on all of this. I like our last correspondence where we discussed all necessary points quickly and were able to relax the remaining 48 hours.\n\nSincerely,\nFrance\r\n1 GERMANY -> FRANCE: France,\n\nAustria is pissed, Really annoyed, I dislike his attitude. He started the round furious with me that I did not move on Russia. I conclude that perhaps that was the turn to make the plunge. As Germany, it is usually my preference to wait for a new build ( or 2) before heading EAST. Austria could be useful, but his outburst, if he was so adamant that I move EAST, he should have sent me more press, might have changed my mind.\n\nHolland is headed to Edi.\n\nAlso, You mentioned the risk of Germany attacking France. as mentioned before. Keeping defensive is useful to show others that I will not go down easily, Waiting for the proper time to committ. It seemed to me that gunning for Warsaw and losing Munich to potentially save Austria was a losing bet. I am trying different strategies as compared to my Round 1 and 2 Games. I don't want to attack France and I really don't want to be attacked by a France-russia Team. My greatest concern. Something I hope my actions have shown a deference to long-term good moves over short-term gains.\n\nAs for the Bounce, without the proper press, I am uncertain how much can be accomplished by feigning aggression towards each other. Which I think A Bounce has that as its primary Purpose. I don't think it would build a tremendous amount of trust between the both of us.\n\nSincerely,\nGermany\n\nAlso. IRI SEA to Wales prepares for NTH SEA to take London in the fall.\r\n2 FRANCE -> GERMANY: Dear Germany,\n\nI have received Austria's messages as well. Considers everyone to be fools, which is a little off and definitely unpleasant to talk to. That being said, we can still work with him.\n\nI think there is a misunderstanding as I have had no issues with your defensive positioning on land presently. The issue is that I am not doing that vice versa. So in that regard two things:\n\n- the bounce in Bur effectively ensures I keep Bur safe. It is not about deceiving the others, it is about ensuring that Bur sees no German army. I have already build A Bre at your request, so Bel-bur to bounce is my only option. It would be really strange if you would not be willing to do this, and your message therefore surprised me.\n- You don't want to be attacked by a France-russia team, which is fully understandable. But by not attacking either of us, particularly Russia I would expect, you are allowing them to grow, more and more. Russia is set to have another build this year at least and probably two. At a given time, Russia alone will be sufficient to attack you and there wont be much I can do at that time to help you. Additionally, by not attacking I remain uncertain whether you and I have an allegiance or Russia and you, and that requires me to keep most units at our borders rather than moving them away to Italy.\n\nI don't get much of what the Austrian player is saying, but I do agree with him that your state of peace with Russia has become dangerous.\n\nNormally, in case of a jugg, everyone turns around immediately. I often find that a little naive. But I do think now the time has come. It is why I also build that Mar fleet and actually wanted to deploy Iri south as well.\n\nThe moves I'd suggest would therefore be:\nSpring:\n- Germany: Nth C & Lvp S Hol-edi, Den-ska, Ber-sil or (depending on whether you think Boh will move out, Ber-pru and Mun-sil)\n- France: Lvp S Hol-edi, Eng S Iri-wal or Eng C Bre-wal S by Iri, Bel-bur if Mun is staying put\n- Autumn: you keep Edi and take Nwy, and perhaps even War, while I take Lon\n\nThat is an unstoppable attack and gets us both at 8. How amazing would that be...\n\nPlease consider this path carefully and let me know what you think.\n\nKind regards,\nFrance\r\n3 FRANCE -> GERMANY: Dear Germany,\n\nDeadline will be in the middle of the night for me. I hope I will hear from you approximately 3-4hrs prior to the deadline.\n\nIf you do the math, I think you'll see it's a win-win for us both. If you'd disagree, please let me know. Essential for me is that both allies are happy with their respective moves and positions.\n\nKind regards,\nFrance\r\n4 GERMANY -> FRANCE: France,\nThe moves seem reasonable. I have no problems with them.\nAs for the Bur move. I am fine with the bounce, I am just not usually Someone who bounces in my games. It is a personal preference. I will send you another message as I continue to look at the board.\n\nGermany\r\n5 FRANCE -> GERMANY: Thanks Germany. Don't wait too long. I am gone with the girl on a trip, and getting a little drunk:-) bedtime in about 2hrs! Thanks\r\n6 FRANCE -> GERMANY: &with the firm\r\n7 FRANCE -> GERMANY: Dear germany,\nJust to be clear here. If I don't get confirmation for Hol-edi prior to deadline, I will keep my [374093] moves.\nwith all best intentions and hoping to avoid a misunderstanding,\nFrance\r\n8 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Hello.\r\n9 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Holt o Edi is the plan and we bounce in Bur. right?\r\n10 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Confirmation.\r\n11 GERMANY -> FRANCE: We good?\r\n",

I will NOT be able to support your move from Tyrolia since he is now in Venice. If you want Vienna, go for it. My money is on the premise that he will hold Venice and support hold from Trieste. I will cut his support from Trieste using the army in Albania.\r\n4 RUSSIA -> ITALY: I could cut Budapest and you take Trieste and Venice?\r\n5 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Here is my proposal. I will move from Tyrolia to Vienna with your support. While he will be hell-bent on holding Trieste, he won't let either of us take Vienna uncontested. He will have to move there from Budapest and hope for a bounce with you and/or me.\r\n6 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Alright, support you in I will. I expect Bud next year though\r\n7 ITALY -> RUSSIA: I also figure that he will hold Trieste and support hold from Venice.

See any problems with that strategy?\r\n8 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Yes on Bud next year.\r\n9 ITALY -> RUSSIA: I am a little afraid of the fleet in the Aegean. My gut says he will stay close to support his armies in the Balkans, but I am a little afraid of a move to the Ionian with a convoy to Tunis.\r\n10 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Well, in that case you can easily recapture tunis, and you can do much damage to him on land. Vienna falls this year, he will not get venice, he is losing bulgaria, and you will get a build and be hot on his tail into tunis. Just move rome to venice, not adriatic. If he does move to Ionian, build in the spring at naples and move naples to tyrr, and adriatic to ionian. You'll never even lose tunis durin the build phase\r\n11 ITALY -> RUSSIA: It's done.\r\n",

Defense of my territory, maybe broker something regarding Italy's fleet in the Ionian.\r\n3 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: You have a lot of holes though so it may be hard to defend it all.\r\n4 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I wish you luck with the guessing game if Italy indeed attacks you\r\n5 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: It is a fragile position...\r\n6 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I think Ankara is my safest option\r\n7 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: If I take it, Turkey is done.\r\n8 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: Go for it.\r\n9 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: Defend Trieste with something is probably your best option.

Shoulda supported Greece and bounced Trieste like I told you. :(\r\n19 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I didn't attack you at all. Wanted you to live through that.\r\n20 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: Yeah... kinda stupid on my part, but I was wary of trickery on your end.\r\n21 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I understand. Well you should have trusted me. I proved you wrong.\r\n22 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I'm stopping the German thing, that's for sure.\r\n23 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: Yeah. Oh well. I think I can recover... leaving me a clear path of expansion that is not you.\r\n24 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: Italy is getting 3 builds.\r\n25 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: It'll be five versus five, since he has three units in the West.\r\n26 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I think I have no choice but to disband in Bulgaria.\r\n27 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I would toss Boh or Mun and head over to help your home. Bulgaria means a free piece for the Turks and they will get a build. Can't allow that.\r\n28 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: Is that okay?\r\n29 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: Maybe even Alb.\r\n30 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I need the two northern pieces to defend.\r\n31 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: Do what you must.\r\n32 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: And Bulgaria will still be lost.

I will leave you alone - even offer support when I can for Munich, and you focus your efforts on England or Russia's end if you're concerned.\n\nYou're right about Germany being difficult. A war on 3-fronts is not easy.\n\nWhat do you say about backing off Tyrolia? I'll leave you alone, maybe offer support where you need it, and\r\n1 ITALY -> GERMANY: we can both be happy, maybe?\r\n2 GERMANY -> ITALY: Think I will just torget this crap and let someone else take over.\r\n3 ITALY -> GERMANY: It's up to you, mate. I would personally rather see you through till the end, but I understand. I have to withdraw from another game I'm playing because I don't have time for as many as I'd signed up for.\n\nIn any case, if you go Tyr-> Munich this turn. Then switch around to occupy Ruhr, you should be able to take back Kiel.\n\nI am, as always, occupied with France. And reminder that I've never done anything against you in this game & I attacked Austria instead of you and held onto all the promises I made you. I tried to warn you about England too. It would be good to work together properly, but you have to make up your mind in order for that to happen.\r\n4 GERMANY -> ITALY: He is so stupid. We were playing the western triple and we had the grip on Russia thanks to me. I would have been willing to go for a 4 way draw which would have included one more party, e.g. you.\r\n5 ITALY -> GERMANY: I think the greed got through :/ You're wide open in the back, and breaking the bottleneck in Livonia-moscow is going to be a challenge that again, relies on you. I think he maybe thought that he had more gains via attacking you (technically not wrong there but ouch).\r\n6 ITALY -> GERMANY: I think France and England always had the solo win in mind. Like shit, England's gonna be at [1446644] the next turn.\r\n7 ITALY -> GERMANY: I'm pretty sure NS is going to SKA to get take Sweden too.\r\n8 GERMANY -> ITALY: I will help Russia kick him out of Stp at least.\r\n9 ITALY -> GERMANY: That's awesome. Good little kick back at him.\nFrance also mentioned that he hadn't approved of the Eng stab on you. He's got Brest uncovered. Maybe there's support to be had there.\nI would've wanted a 4-way with you, me, Turkey and Russia, haha. T-R have been nice to me thus far.\r\n10 GERMANY -> ITALY: England has blocked the chat with me. I never experienced that before. I just wrote him that I was sorry to see his betrayal of the western triple, that's all.\r\n11 ITALY -> GERMANY: Is that even possible??\r\n12 ITALY -> GERMANY: Are you supporting Moscow into Stp with Finland?\r\n",

Anything we can do to undermine the R/I alliance is a good idea. I suspect it will be easier to get Italy to turn on Russia than Russia to turn on Italy.\r\n1 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Yeah, Italy has already contacted me to fight Russia, but has not made any clear proposals yet. You will be getting London now, right? Need me to do anything?\r\n2 GERMANY -> FRANCE: If you want I can convoy Belgium army somewhere\r\n3 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I'll take London and I should be able to support you into Edi by next fall. I'll have Bel support hold Holland. We should be wary of Russia. He's got fleets in the north and is looking at a build or two from the soutH--I would like us to get a good position on him and leverage Italy and Turkey as well. Sil - Pru, Mun - Sil when Russia doesn't expect it--and is overextended in the north--would be good for both of us. I'm sure there is a good chance Turkey will work with Italy as well--he has no friends otherwise and Russia's too big.\r\n4 FRANCE -> GERMANY: If you'll consider it, I have an idea. I can support you into London so you get a fleet build. You'll really need it against Russia--and then you can move north against Edi and I'll take London later. What do you say--interested?\r\n5 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Wow, that is very generous. Would certainly need that build to fight Russia.\r\n6 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Sil to Prussia won't do though. Italy wants me to hit Galicia. I think that is a good road to explore\r\n7 FRANCE -> GERMANY: You're right, even better to hit Gal, so Russia might lose Bud. I have ordered the support for NTH into London. Any advice for Mar/Munich?\r\n8 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Moving Munich to Boh probably. Would not mind if you move Mar to Gascony so you can convoy north\r\n9 FRANCE -> GERMANY: Not a bad idea, either of them. Hopefully my gambit with England will pay off and he will cover Liverpool as I expect.\r\n10 FRANCE -> GERMANY: Support locked in. See you on the other side.\r\n",

I can move Vienna to Tyrolia and Trieste/Adratic can bounce in Venice to keep it safe. a gamble i know but you're in a pretty tight spot so think you need to take some chances.\r\n2 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: so how do you want to play it against France?\r\n3 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: i am moving to Venice (with support from you if possible), and then move to the Tyrr.

Naples to Rome; Ionian to Naples and I move Adriatic to Ionain with support from Greece. That would allow us to have 3 on two v. French fleets next turn. ~N~ ~N~ Will also support Rome to Venice.\r\n12 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: if that comes off leaves us in a much more secure position against France and we can start to push him back.\r\n13 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Still in this game my friend!! This turn I propose that you must try and break into Tyrrh Sea or grab Tunis back. So i reckon you move Ionian to Tyrrh Sea with support from Naples. Whilst I order Greece to Ionian with support. Outcome will be on of the following: ~N~ a) Gol defends Tyrr Sea in which case your move fails, but because I attacked Ionian you'll be able to retreat to Tunis (and we have a 3 on 2 for Tyrr Sea in Autumn ~N~ b) France moves to defend Tunis in some way.... which means you will gain Tyrr Sea and I get into Ionian. This will allow us to attack Tunis in Autumn or reclaim Rome if it falls in the Spring. ~N~ ~N~ Either outcome puts in a much stronger position going forwards. You might have to say goodbye to Venice in the short-term, but I reckon we have a good chance of getting in back at some stage. And I'll support you to Venice from Rome this turn via Trieste if you like. ~N~ if this works then great news, if it doesn't then it must mean that Gol was defending Tyrr Sea. So my\r\n",

The fake stab worked out much better than planned for me, it seems :p\r\n3 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Lol, its quite a genius tactic a fake stab, never done it before... but just to make sure, if you move Gre-bulg that will simply move greece to bulg assuming that Con doesnt move to Bulg, A serbia to Bulg with [1151919] support would make for the stalemate\r\n4 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Also, could you ask Turkey to support Smy-gre again?

Namely, France's lower Scs, and the ability to get into MAO early on =)\r\n9 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Lol, wow, you have some quite advanced strategies... Do the three years without builds not hinder Italy? Equally, in this scenario, does Italy have good relations with Austria but leave him to take on turkey alone?\r\n10 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: In this scenario, Austria does have to take on Turkey alone, so hopefully there's no Juggernaut. Cease and desist if there is. The builds can hurt, but then a boom of three Sc's is enough to recover; most countries don't have more than 6 centers by Spring '04, so that'll put you from the underdog to the head of the pack. Not only do you surprise everyone, you cripple France, and get your builds to help Austria out with.\nThen you earn Austria's eternal gratitude from saving him from the Turk =)\r\n11 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Lol, sounds good, youre probably right about few countries having more than 6 Sc's by 04 so thats reasonable. It also seems wise to aid Austria against a Juggernaut...\r\n12 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Hehe, I like it when people aid Austria in a Juggernaut ;)\r\n13 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: :D\n\nFake stabs have got to be one of the best aspects of Diplomacy, I cant believe its taken me 50 odd games to perform one :S\r\n14 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Hehe, I didn't start until later on too. At this point, I'm just experimenting for fun openings and such. Otherwise I wouldn't have attacked Germany this early on =S\r\n15 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Lol!\r\n",

At the worst, you'll still be bouncing him in Albania...\r\n5 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: Yes, of course. My hope is exactly to bounce him in Albania letting Serbia as is to attack Trieste next turn.\r\n6 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: Great. So you'll just bounce, and I'll just hold for this turn, right?\r\n7 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: That's what I hope.\r\n8 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I've got some information from Italy and am acting on it. (It's not directed against you, don't worry) I don't really want to say what though... You could probably guess, if you tried though.\r\n9 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: Is something about Albania?\r\n10 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: Nope. I would have told you that.... Aww hell, if your gonna grill me... :) He's moving Trieste to Serbia, expecting support from me. But, since he's moving it, he can't support hold that unit. So, I'll just take Trieste.\r\n11 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: Ok, so please remember to move Rumania in Serbia, just in case I'll not bounce in Albania.\r\n12 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: Yep, it's set to go.\r\n",

Again, I personally think that is dangerous and plays into the AH/T alliance hands... ~N~ I am hoping we can be friendly here...I have no interest in being enemies. I am not playing for the win here (not sure anyone is)\r\n1 ITALY -> ENGLAND: Does that mean that You have changed Your mind & You will still move into Med? As I told (and I will keep repeating it) - currently it's not necessary - there are many reasons of it, including me feeling pretty threatened by Your presence when I don't see direct benefit in Your presence. ~N~ ~N~ You can move to GOL if You want (which is 1 move away from Tyr) through Spain if You wish. I think I'm able to forecast my situation ahead at least 1 turn, so I could turn to You in case of need.\r\n2 ENGLAND -> ITALY: wow - thats good of you! ~N~ dont worry, I only have my own interests at heart. I will consider whether or not I will move to Wmed. Unless there is something you could offer me to dissuade me from coming to protect you :)\r\n3 ITALY -> ENGLAND: So now You are already admitting that You are actually willing to pick up some of my Sc-s from behind (taking that Your last post already sounded much like blackmail)...?\r\n4 ENGLAND -> ITALY: \"So now You are already admitting that You are actually willing to pick up some of my Sc-s from behind\" - what did I say to suggest this? ~N~ when did you start getting paranoid? I thought you only used logic and rational supposition :)\r\n5 ENGLAND -> ITALY: there is a very fine line between negociating and blackmail - i think im still the right side of the line :)\r\n6 ITALY -> ENGLAND: what did You say to suggest Your evil intentions? You said this: ~N~ ~N~ I will consider whether or not I will move to Wmed. Unless there is something you could offer me to dissuade me from coming to protect you :) ~N~ ~N~ So, as I understood - unless I have some really good arguments against it, You will move to Wesmed, although I have specifically rejected it thrice :P If this doesn't point out some secondary agenda, then what does? Remember, this is diplomacy game - You should choose Your words carefully. Have I misunderstood anything?\r\n7 ITALY -> ENGLAND: ...and about rationality - I do feel that Your move to Med & 'help' You provide, would be irrational - You are wasting Your fleet, without getting anything from me (unless this 'something' You will get, is not something I would like to give)\r\n8 ENGLAND -> ITALY: I must remember to choose my words more carefully in future...here goes ~N~ I am going to move the WMED unless you offer me something to dissuade me from doing so. This will allow me to exert some pressure and influence on other peoples' (including your) decisions in the future of the game. Maybe take your attention away from my potential new friends AH and T :P ~N~ I'm not interested in your view about whether it would help you but I am interested in my view about whether it will help me ~N~ I dont want to stay in MAO for the moment as I own it anyway and I dont want France to feel too threatened ~N~ ~N~ I have made no threats towards you at all...all of the \"evil intentions\" inferences are your own...but thanks for letting me know your thoughts on the subject...it is useful to understand your state of mind and to assess the value of my potential threats against you in WMED ~N~ ~N~ Or maybe I just want you to bounce me there so I stay in MAO (and make it look to France that I tried to move out but you stopped me) and to help out AH/T in eradicating a Great Power from the future draw negociations...who knows? ~N~ ~N~ Is that clear enough? I realise that this didnt need to be said explicitly and none of this passed you by but maybe it will help in our future commincations :) ~N~ Im open to offers/friendly suggestions (havent had any of those from you so far) and would reiterate (notice Re-iterate) my favoured strategy of allying with you against AH/T\r\n9 ITALY -> ENGLAND: I don't think that my former communication has been unfriendly - questioning & searching for reason can't be taken as being unfriendly (and You said it Yourself, that I seem to be rather logical). I'm very interested in cooperating with You, but I would really like it to be clear, transparent and logical - if You are about to cooperate with me, I do want to see also Your side of the benefit. And I don't want to feel threatened. You in Tyr, while I have 3 unoccupied Sc-s around Tyr, feels threatening. I suppose it's clear.\r\n10 ENGLAND -> ITALY: Again - I didnt say it was unfriendly (please stop putting words in my mouth). I say what I say and you hear what you hear (or at least say that you heard what you want me to think that you heard...). That's all very dull and counterproductive. We will achieve more by being straighforward with each other rather than being clever with words:) ~N~ ~N~ It IS threatening I agree....but do you want it to be friendly threatening or aggressive threatening?\r\n11 ITALY -> ENGLAND: I think this must be something with my understanding: ~N~ ~N~ You just wrote me - Again - I didnt say it was unfriendly ~N~ ~N~ Jet You said - Im open to offers/friendly suggestions (havent had any of those from you so far) - which clearly refers (at least to me) that my previous communication has been unfriendly (which is opposite to friendly, which You haven't received). What am I doing wrong here?\r\n12 ITALY -> ENGLAND: ...and I suppose that this piece of communication: ~N~ ~N~ ...but do you want it to be friendly threatening or aggressive threatening? ~N~ ~N~ ..was once again just a friendly reminder that You will move to Wmed whatever I would think & it's up to me if You will become aggressive from this point forward (if I should disagree with the plan) or friendly (in case I should accept the plan). Nevertheless I think it would be threatening to me one way or another ... and I suppose that this is certainly not called blackmailing (sorry).\r\n13 ENGLAND -> ITALY: You are the logician...not being friendly is very different from being unfriendly ~N~ Unfriendly would suggest animosity ~N~ Not friendly just suggestions a lack of active friendliness ~N~ ~N~ Unless you dissuade me from doing so, I will move to WMED from where I will \"threaten\" to take one of your Scs ~N~ Im happy to bounce but then you are open to attack from AH/T ~N~ ~N~ I would consider our relationship neutral currently....if you can help me in some way, maybe I can help you :)\r\n14 ITALY -> ENGLAND: What can I do to help You?\r\n15 ENGLAND -> ITALY: dunno - Im open to offers\r\n16 ITALY -> ENGLAND: if You even have no idea what can I do to help You, then it still amazes me, why would You move Your fleet down there with all this friendliness and sincerity, but I think I'm already about to repeat myself\r\n17 ENGLAND -> ITALY: no doubt you would something different in my shoes :) ~N~ I guess I will make the mistake and reap the consequences...\r\n18 ENGLAND -> ITALY: I am flattered by you quoting me on the amusing comments thread :)\r\n",

Again, shifting your units at the French is pretty critical. I will scramble around to try to kill that army in Budapest. Taking Tyrolia to Piedmont would be ideal while you also shift at least Ionian west. I will try to get Aeg into Bulgaria to give you some peace of mind, but we've come this far so hopefully we can keep this going, nice work!! :-)\r\n1 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Just to be clear, and to keep checking in, it is my opinion that France is the only one left in this game that has a shot at a solo and 14,000 points! Please do not underestimate the strength of France's position on the board, NOBODY is threatening him while everyone else is fighting and not getting anywhere too fast... EXCEPT US!! We are a powerful duo as long as we act as one!! I'm the kind to not fear saying too much, so hope that doesn't rub you the wrong way, I'd rather say what I think rather than say nothing and regret not communicating... I got your back, I'm your ally to the end, I hope you feel the same towards me...\r\n2 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Okay, Austria. I'm with you.\nThat being said, let me throw a couple things out there. I was deeply concerned by the fact that you grew so much faster than I did during those past couple turns, and that you did so by making moves I wasn't expecting. That concern has been greatly diminished by the fact that you let me take Tri.\nBut I also want to mention that other players in this game have theorized that you're [46152]. They describe your playing style as extremely warm and friendly, though not necessarily trustworthy when push comes to shove.\nIf this is true, then we've never played together before, but the description does fit. Under other circumstances I would probably take that information as reason enough to stab right now, even without the fact that you're a little vulnerable. But I'm not going to.\nI've always enjoyed this game more for its tactical elements than the more scheming aspects. I've never relished stabbing, personally. I know I'd be pilloried on the message boards for this, but it always leaves a bad taste in my mouth. MY typical style is to pick an ally and try to stick with them to the end, provided they seem trustworthy and competent. And you do seem to be both of those things (if a little scarily so).\nYou're also absolutely correct about E/F. They'll be the power to beat shortly. So let's settle our corner and turn our attention to them.\nThat's really all I have to say... If it is true that you're [46152] and/or wind up stabbing me in the end, I just want it out there that I considered the possibility, but... I'm just not going to act on it.\nWe've done great so far. I want to play it out.\n\nI'm going to hold Ankara for fall and shift my fleets west one last time. I think Tunis is a good idea, even if he takes Tyr I can just build in Rome and Nap.\nThe biggest question is what to do about Germany. He needs our help.\r\n3 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Glad to hear you are with me!\n\nI know you were concerned. A quick summary of my reasoning was that France was telling me things from you and about aligning with Russia, all to take down Germany. My stab of Russia was a very delicate matter, I could not risk you passing info to France that would end up in the Russian's hands. I have been very forthright about my intentions, which is that you and I remain allies the ENTIRE game while we first secure the southeast stalemate position and then do everything in our power to advance further. Giving you Trieste should ease your concerns tremendously as I would need at least three or four fleets to take you on, yet I have willingly and gladly forfeited that ability in the name of the A/I!!\n\nAlso, as I mentioned before, we had little room for expansion while Russia was in the picture. I stabbed Russia for both of us! You will have seven centers after this autumn and two builds, no way you would have gotten that without me stabbing Russia... Okay, sorry to rehash, I just really want you to understand that being secretive about the east was for our both best interests, in my opinion, or at least that was my intention...\n\nAs far as theories on who each of us really is, I personally don't find that in the spirit of an anonymous game, so I will excuse myself from that conversation. I know others in this game feared my quick growth and it is their obligation to come up with any/every argument they can think of to get you to attack me, but that's also because they all realize how powerful we will be if we do stick together!\n\nI think our style of play is very similar. I do not enjoy stabbing others, though I will do it when I need to, like with the Russian, especially since the Russian and I butted heads earlier in the game, he had it coming in my book. That said, the thing I most enjoy about diplomacy is team play, coordinating an attack that can only be stopped by multiple other players working well together. My style is to find one game-long ally and hope to keep enough chaos everywhere else to allow my two-person alliance to take control of the game, which we are obviously about to do!\n\nTo be honest, the size of this pot has me extremely freaked out, I wish I hadn't joined the game, especially after drawing Austria... This should have been obvious to you from day one, at least my focus on the southeast stalemate and insuring both of our survival, I just want to escape this game alive... As I've said, I'd be more than happy with a four-way draw with E/F, though I must admit now that we have the southeast stalemate well within our grasp I am now hoping to get a three-way draw and more than double our investment... though I suppose I am digressing a bit!\n\nYou need not worry about me stabbing you, we've come too far and are doing too well to throw it all away. Even if I had any thought of stabbing you, which I do not, I know how very powerful the French position can be and my stabbing you would result in a huge risk of a French solo, something there is no way in hell I would want the stress of dealing with! I love it when the little guys stick together and excel, we can be a great example of this and in such a high pot it will be quite the statement!\n\nAs far as Germany, I'm not sure. I know you have not wanted to work with Germany for some time, so I have tried to not push the issue while I focus on the southeast. I will talk with him and see if we can come up with something...\n\nThanks again for sticking with me, you will not regret it and we will both be nicely compensated for it!! :-)\r\n4 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: No problem.\nFiguring out who's who is really just a matter of idle curiosity on my part. To tell the truth, I've also been convinced you were [90817], since I have played with him before and he tends to post long messages (and because he's the only person who I know for a fact is in the game). But I don't really need to know.\nAnd I know what you mean about the pot, I was extremely hesitant about joining the game myself. And imagine my joy at discovering I drew Italy. Haha.\nI think I've changed my mind in regards to Germany. I was pretty furious with him for jerking me around, but at this point I think his strategic importance to us is too high. We need him as a buffer against France and England. If he manages to hold up for a year or two, I don't think we'll have to settle for a draw- We should be able to win it all ourselves (or with Germany if we decide to share).\n\nThat being said, let's talk strat.\nWe need to finish off Russia as quick as possible so we can turn our attention West. Germany mentioned you offered to help him into St. Pete. I think it's a good idea. Wiping out Russia's Scs is worth it, even if he doesn't keep Norway.\n\nIn the South, I wonder if you might want to move Aeg Sea to Ionian? This was actually Germany's idea, but it did make sense. With Russia and Turkey gone, you'll need other ways to expand. Germany's worried you'll go for him, and I'm worried it'll be me (obviously less so now, but there's no sense in being reckless). With two builds I can start next year with fleets in Tunis, Rome, Napoli, and one of our fleets in Ion, which is more than enough to sweep France.\nBut if it's your fleet acting as the tip of the spear, we can all be confident that you have a way of gaining Scs without a stab. Does that work for you?\nLet me know what you think.\r\n5 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I'm a bit short on time, busy weekend!\n\nAeg can move to Ion, that unit won't have much to do, so it is free to submit whatever orders you like, just keep me posted and it will do as told! :-)\n\nI figure we'll all want to get to about 11 centers for a three-way draw, if we go that route. With this pot, I'd be more than happy to sit back and watch you and the German kill off E and F. I figure as you expand, we can transfer ownership of Ank and Smy eventually, making sure I get your blessing as to exactly when to take them. I'd even like Trieste back eventually, but that can wait for 5 years or so if need be, I'm in no rush... though that would put me at 12 if I got all those, so maybe you can keep Trieste the entire game, it will be a good symbol of our alliance for all to see!\n\nSo, for now I'll assume Age to Ion, but let me know if that changes, I'll check back in before orders go through.\r\n6 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Great! Head to Ionian, we'll start breaking France right away!\nI'm going to leave Tyrolia where it is for now. Moving it now would probably just tip off the French to no benefit. At the start of next year I can either send it to Pie or help Germany with defending Munich.\r\n7 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Any chance Tyrolia and Trieste could bounce in Vienna?\r\n8 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Or Trieste support Rum to Bud?\r\n9 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Crap, wish I had been a little more organized and sent you a message sooner, sorry...\r\n10 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: No, the bounce would work better, if you can do it, I may switch things up a bit...\r\n11 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Oh, never mind, I worked it out, sorry for all those messages...\r\n",

I dont know who to beleive... but I really do think you and I have the start of an effective alliance here... and I hope you dont plan on throwing it away for an 'early stab' when you can take Hol, Kie, Ber, and Stp within the next 2 years...\r\n7 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: HAHAHA\nThat is funny because it is Austria who is desperatly trying to get me to move against you. I was playing along with him (without any intentions). So obviously his whole point is to get us to fight between ourselves.\n\nTrust me I have no intentions of stabing you right after I stabed Germany. As you pointed it out there are more than enough SC for me to get right now that I do not need another enemy.\n\nWe have worked too hard to establish this alliance that it would be foolish to throw it all away on a pointless stab.\r\n8 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: alrigh... i believe you far more than I believe him... so I'm sticking to the original plan.\n\nwas russia definitive about cutting sil?\r\n9 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: Yes he was definite.

You might want to divert your attention to the East; Russia is expanding at an alarming rate; I think I can handle France by myself.\r\n1 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Hmmm, it might be in your best interest to support Vienna into Tyrolia, so Austria can attempt to regain Italy.\r\n2 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I'm going to finally get around to taking Denmark, I'm sure you wont miss it (After all, that fleet in the North Sea isn't doing a whole lot!)\r\n3 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: No, please don't take it yet until I have indeed gained an SC, like I'm not kidding. I actually will miss the fleet in the North Sea, quite a bit. The reason being is that it's there to prevent you from getting any ideas, or do anything stupid with Holland. Plus, you won't even need the SC; as you said last turn, you won't have enough open Sc's to build at.\r\n4 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: If that was a lame attempt to stab me, nice try.\r\n5 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: If that was a lame attempt to stab me, nice try.\r\n6 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I honestly would've believed you if you said it was to protect Norway, but at least I know the real reason for it being there.\n\nBut, allow me to dig through the archived messages:\n(To: You, from England) - Autumn, 1901: Would you be okay if I took Denmark?\n(To: England, from you) - Autumn, 1901: For the time being, it would be fine. So long as I can have it once you gain control of Sweden.\n(To: You, from England) - Autumn, 1901: Okay, sounds good.\n\nNow, if you don't trust me, I don't really care.\nI know I'm not going to invade you, but it isn't of too much concern to me right now if you don't think so too. I'm sure you can see that there's really nothing I can do with my fleet in Holland that can't be rectified /very/ swiftly by your forces.\n\nIf anything, I shouldn't be trusting you; You've tried to stop me from taking Denmark on two occasions now. The first was understandable, but now your only reason for not giving it to me is that it will deny you a navy that is directed /against me/.\nYou can take Marseilles without opposition, and you can get Spain the turn after that, then you'll have two navies to stop me from 'getting any ideas'\r\n7 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Protect Norway? Read the map more carefully next time. If you really want to know, I didn't want to shift too much of the blame onto you. But yes, not only is it to protect Sweden, it's to protect the rest of my northern front. If you invade Sweden, you essentially get Norway and St.p gets taken by Russia.\n/sigh\nBack to reasoning again, do I really need to write you a whole other essay to explain again? Mind you, I have a life too, that took a lot of time last time, and it was during finals week, but I felt it was crucial to explain to you.\nJust to let you think a bit, why are you trying to shift the blame on me? Preventing you from taking Denmark? I was exerting logic, something you seem to lack. That is fine, however, it is something that is acquired after playing a lot of games. Also, for the record, I've had the chance to attack, and take over your Sc's ever since the beginning of the game, especially when you almost lost them all. However, I stuck with it, I stuck through your rash thinking, and I was finally able to convince you for the better. Is this what I get? Back to SC greed?\n/sigh\r\n8 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Gah, I feel as if I'm being too pushy, but this seems like the only way to get my point across. Am I overlooking something? This is usually how how dissent works in diplomacy; somebody overlooks something. Would you mind reasoning with me and presenting your point?\r\n9 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: If I'm such a rash thinker, why wouldn't I have tried something yet?\nAs I said before, why would I want you to keep a fleet that is only going to be used against me?\nI'm going to take Denmark, and I honestly don't see why I shouldn't. You'll only lose a fleet in the North Sea, which is protecting the British Isles from an invasion that is never going to come. I was promised Denmark a long time ago, and I will be taking it.\n\nNow, if I do pull some ridiculous move on your homeland, you can easily drive me out with your new Sc's in Marseilles and Spain. If I take Sweden, I can't take Norway until I get another fleet, by which time you will also have a new fleet, thus denying me any further conquests in Scandinavia.\r\n10 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Posted that before I saw your last message.\nBut in summary, I wont (But more importantly, /can't/) do anything to damage you if I take Denmark.\nI just want an extra army to Push through my east. In all honesty, I'm worried about simply being swallowed up (By you, Russia or Italy). Let's not let this screw with our growth.\r\n11 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Okay, you honestly have to look from my position. If you enter the North Sea, I am very, very screwed. Even if I took your Sc's, I wouldn't be able to compensate for the loss. How about this, you wait the turn, and take Denmark in Autumn. You'll get your build, you'll get the SC, there won't be much of difference, expect you aren't given a chance to take Sweden aswell, okay?\nAlso, what's the plan.\r\n12 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I may not get a response before the phase change, as I may be sleeping. Anyways, you seem really pissed at me because I'm asking you to defer a turn on taking Denmark, which is a complete mystery to me, but oh well. In order to keep this alliance from imploding, why don't you take Denmark this turn, so you're not all pissed at me. Aside from this, I'm supporting to Holland to Belgium from, right? (so France doesn't get it). I'm pretty sure France will fall within two years, xD.\r\n13 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Well, it doesn't really matter all that much if I defer taking Denmark (Unless, as I said, I make some mad/pointless dash at Sweden.\nI'll take Denmark this turn, and prove to you that I'm not out to destroy you!\n\nAnd yeah, Support Belgium from Holland, because he'll probably move there.\r\n14 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I think I can cover France on my own, you can start moving west against Russia and Italy. Perhaps you can help Austria into Italy? Italy is expanding [1244914] to fast.\r\n15 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I think you mean east! ;)\nBut yes, I've been worried about Italy for a while now, I get the feeling he's working with Russia. But if I expand into Russia, Italy will probably see little reason to stand by him, so he'll snap up a few Sc's.\n\nI did consider going for Austria's Sc's directly, but his armies are the only thing between Italy and the Rest of Eastern Europe.\r\n",

SO that makes things easy and obvious for me-I trust you way more than him, he wants me to stab you but he has not been very convincing because his actions do not go along with his words. You on the other hand are dependable and trustworthy, you have great follow-thru and do exactly what you say you're gonna do, So that fleet is just going to sit around up there\r\n9 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: wait Den cant go to BAL either, its an army\r\n10 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: scratch that, I see it now HEL-DEN then DEN-BAL\r\n11 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: so I am still looking at option 3 - convoying MAR-TUS. not sure what you meant that \"the convoy won't work with his fleets there\" .

Hurrah! Am shattered, but it was well worth it. Not sure if I missed a turn or not here, but am going to try and grab Berlin if I can get Warsaw into position. Will also try and get behind into Armenia and support you into Smyrna. Not sure if that will happen, but we can but try.\r\n2 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Correction - just realised what you said. There is a large ethnic population in [1402409], but generally they don't really vote. Basically, due to the system, if a minor party gets just 5% of the vote in the London wide member top up system, they will get a seat - hence [267081].\r\n3 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Thanks.

Do you want to work together anymore?\r\n3 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Yes. I don't want to die.\r\n4 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: OK. As you can see, I didn't take NTH even though I could have forced myself in. I could this turn, but it's more valuable to you than to me, and France is likely to take IRI and ENG, so you'll really need your build and your two fleets to hold onto your territories.\n\nSo, would you consider helping me if it meant I wouldn't attack NTH?\r\n5 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Rather, would you consider helping me if it meant I wouldn't attack NTH or Edi?\r\n6 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Hello?\r\n7 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Yes, of course I would. You're the only one that attempts to even communicate with me.\r\n8 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: And I do appreciate that you kept NTHS free.\r\n9 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: However, there is no way that I believe that Russia really attacked you. You don't need to be sneaky about it. I am already dead. The scandinavian split like this makes sense for both you and Russia, and you used the retreat as a free move to the Norwegian. You cannot retake Norway without me, and you want to have me \"support\" it so my fleet is frozen and you take Edinburg.\n\nIf you really want Edinburg, just say it and we all can save some time and bullshit.\n\nIf I'm completely wrong, then where is your benefit in helping/using me?\r\n10 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Well, it's up to you. I want a center, and I have very few options. One is Norway. One is Edinburgh. If you want to help me, the benefit for you is that you guarantee your replacement build, peace in the north, and I can help you strike back at France. I benefit from a build of my own, a more reasonable path of expansion, and a smart partner in you. I know you're an excellent player, and F/G is pretty obvious to everyone, so it'd be smart to switch it up. I'm also reasonable; I know that if you want to play for the long-term, you'll need new Scs, and I see at least three different Scs that you should have, and they're within your reach, but you'll need me on your side.\n\nThis is a big game and I think we should make it count. You and I both have more to gain in the long run.\r\n11 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: And yes, you're right that I would like your support into Norway, but if you offered it to me I would actually attack Norway.\r\n12 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Further, if you support me into Norway, I'd have no reason attack NTH.\r\n13 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: It'd also mean a vacant NWG.\r\n14 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I will be back in 20 minutes (currently 5:07 EST); I hope to hear from you.\r\n15 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I will support Norwegian Sea to Norway.\r\n16 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Awesome; thank you. Norwegian Sea will move to Norway.\r\n17 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: If Russia doesn't fill his orders in time, you still will follow through with this agreement?\r\n18 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Yes, I will.\r\n19 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Thanks, and good luck. I think you should cover London; it's more likely that France will attempt IRI, but once you get your build, you'll be able to put it in Liverpool, and better that than lose an SC. France will fall quickly.\r\n20 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Allow me to rephrase: I think you should cover London with Wales. With your help into Norway, NWG will be vacant and a build in Liverpool will cover you from a French fleet in IRI.\r\n21 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Do you plan for Italy to help against France (Marseilles)? I don't see France falling quickly without Italy's support.\r\n22 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I've suggested that he move back to Piedmont; I hope that he does. He'll probably get a build this turn, and he'll probably build a fleet against France.\r\n",

        "intent_dialogue": "0 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Do you see that? I am so sick of Germany's bullshit it's agonizing. Again and again he does this, he stirs me against France and then backs away. I'm done. Let's wipe him out.\r\n1 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I was going to ask, him moving out of Bur really took all pressure off of France and it totally does hang you out to dry. The moves in the east went beautifully, I can stick with the Russian or go with the German, so if you want to continue on with the German then that's what we'll do. I recommend not telling the German, though, if you've sent somewhat of an upset message to him already, I recommend slowly backing away from the rage so we can sneak attack him! Also, we could use your help finishing off the Turk if you think you can spare a the fleet in Ion, which may be a nice olive branch to offer France? Let me know what you'd like to do!\r\n2 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: No no, I haven't spoken with anyone yet but you. With Germany I'm going to keep playing the fool. I'll olive branch France, and move to Tyr, and I'll bring the fleet back. What about you? Send Bud to Vie, definitely.\nRussia's going to need a lot of help soon. But if we hold all his centers this year, we should be able to start pushing Germany back next year.\nA big thing will be getting France in on it. I'm going to try to talk with him and feel him amount- I'll tell him we were moving against Germany the whole time, but it might help if you spoke to him independently.\nLemme know.\r\n3 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I'm actually not concerned at all about Russia falling. My #1 priority in this game is to secure a southeast stalemate position with you. Bringing Ion back to East Med will insure we take out Turkey and worst case the two of us can survive this game, even if it means ultimately the German and I take out Russia. I will continue to work with Russia this season as killing Turkey is the first step in our goal. Peace with France would be great for you and I've touched base with him briefly, I am confident we can smooth things over with him. Ultimately, if we draw this game with France and Germany, I'd be more than happy with a four-way, though a three-way would obvioubly be better since it would be fun to more than double our investment in this game! We'll see, but seeking revenge on the German is not my #1 priority at the moment, so I'd like to bounce in Trieste again to insure you are not in panic mode, if you don't mind, while Pie goes to Tyrolia to smooth things over with the Frenchman. Sound okay? Again, a southeast stalemate for us two is my absolute top priority, especially since we are Italy and Austria, we MUST stick together... though they say the best way to keep an ally from stabbing you is to not let them, which is why I prefer to bounce in Trieste. I know it doesn't appear to be trusting, but there is no way the German can attack us, so I'd prefer to take it slow and careful than get too far out of position, I hope you understand!! :-)\r\n4 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I know it looks like I've lost all perspective, but really, I haven't. I am furious, no doubt, but I have never been thrilled with Germany's size, and I know you recall that I've never really trusted him, either. He's bad for us, Austria. He's a threat. I understand if you want to take it slow and methodical, but I am certain that no good can come of him. I was even before this past move.\n\nI sent France a message. He probably hates me though, I'll have to see how he responds...\nTurkey will be put down next year. I'll send the fleet back, but I'm not even sure it'll be necessary. Turkey disbands at least one next turn. Then he cracks completely.\n\nWhat's Sil's plan? It would help to know what you and Russia have going up there.\n\nAs for Tyr, I'm gonna send Pie, but I want to support it in with Ven. I know you want to bounce, but I want the extra assurance of the supported move. If you want to cover Tri that's cool, but you're not getting stabbed by me. A shift to Vie would really add some pressure on Germany, and pressure will make him more stressed, and more stressed means more sloppy.\r\n5 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Also, I think it's too early to be breaking it down to a 4 or even 3 way draw. Yeah, that's still a really great haul, but you and me together are in a solid position. We play smart and I think we could really take it.\r\n6 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Do you want me to support Bul to Con?\r\n7 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Alright, your thoughts on the German are fully noted now. I've heard from the Frenchman and my take is that he can/will trust you/us, at least in the short term while the German is so powerful and aligned with the Englishman, he doesn't really have much of a choice and it isn't too much of a gamble for him since it will take you a while to reach him so he can afford to sit back and watch your moves this season to get more information. If you cut him a bunch of slack, it will be warmly welcomed, I think, especially if you tell him you thought him and the German were hiding their alliance and you were merely anticipating MAO to North Africa and Mar to West Med... though I guess that doesn't explain Pie real well, so maybe don't bring that up!\n\nYeah, I guess with the disband Turkey will fall easily enough, so the Ionian fleet won't really be needed, though I'd certainly not recommend holding in Tyrr and taking Tunis. I think it would be prudent to have a fleet in Tyrr or Tunis and one in Ion, as long as Pie goes to Tyrolia, which sounds like the plan.\n\nRussia and I haven't figure out our plan yet, so we'll see. Russia isn't real responsive, which falls in line with his NMR.\n\nThanks for the thoughts regarding supporting yourself into Tyrolia and not bouncing in Tri. I'll think on that and see if I go to Vie or Tri, but remember I will get a build for Bul, so I can build in Vie just as easily as go there this move, so I'm leaning towards building there, even if it delays the Germans stress by a few hours! ;-)\n\nAs far as draws, I try to not get greedy and take baby steps. I'm not just going to sit on the southeast stalemate line, but it does seem to be a logical first step in advancing ourselves in this game. I am very open-minded and like to take what the game gives me, so count me in for advancing as far as possible, even if I talk four-way draw along the way.\r\n8 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: PS - Hey, yeah, please use Smy to support Bul to Con, Sev will hit Black Sea and Greece will support Rum to Bul, it would be great to have Turkey with only one unit after this year!\r\n9 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Sounds cool all 'round. Yeah, fine, a build in Vie might actually be preferable now that you mentioned it. Kind of a nasty surprise... What're you gonna do with Sil? Lots of possibilities. Hitting Berlin might be sweet. It won't work, I'm sure. But maybe if you really sold Germany on your honesty it might. Either way it pulls a unit off the assault on St. Pete.\nRegarding Turkey: I'm glad to see he'll finally be outta here. I'll leave my fleets where they are.\nOnce in Tyrolia, after the build, you could even support Tyr to Boh from Vie and/or Sil, while Ven moves up to Tyr. That would put at least 3 of our units on Munich. Plus maybe a French army in Bur? Germany will panic. The most important thing to do now is prevent a German build this year. I don't see how he could get one, but provided he fails, we will start to push him back next year already!\nWe are in good shape.\r\n10 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Sil is set to hit Munich, I figure Berlin will be covered for sure and it's worth a shot... though maybe Munich and Baltic will bounce in Berlin and I should support Munich to Berlin instead? I'll be glad to see Turkey dead as well, of course, then we can focus northward and clean up the German. Moving units all around Munich is a great plan, though we can fine tune as we go. Yep, we're in great shape!\r\n11 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: YES! Support Munich to Berlin! That's a hilariously good idea. If it works, then Germany's defenses look like a funhouse-mirror version of what he wants. If it fails, then it will appear to him like you're harmless and you can maybe sell him on that lie. I love it.\r\n12 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Hmmm... I'm rethinking things a bit, but it's an option. Not sure exactly how to best take advantage of the northeast, but I'll think on it a bit more and see what I can come up with...\r\n",

Please explain how.\n\nNow if Turkey attacked you... that might be problematic for you.\r\n5 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Turkey cannot attack me without notice.\nI mean, to take bud he will need to move to rum first.\nSo whoever enters rum without permission is a stabber.\nAnd a stab that happens with 1 turn notice cannot work\nIf I attacked Turkey I would maybe be able to get rum and that's it while giving you and Germany the chance to turn around against me.\nOn the other hand we can just keep the juggernaut going against the easy target, Italy :)\r\n6 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Well last turn you didn't support hold Budapest, so he doesn't have to take anything first.\n\nStabs can work if they take a while. Getting the first shot off gives an advantage.\n\nI think you are massively over estimating me and Germanys ability to attack you.\n\nIf you took Trieste (easy take) Rumania and the Black Sea, you will have me as an ally, because its alot easier for me to attack Turkey, and he will be worn down. Losing two centres for Turkey is a big hit. Then he disbands, you take Armenia. He collapses.\n\nIts actually pretty easy stuff.\r\n7 ITALY -> RUSSIA: I mean, I feel like im beating the same old drum because you dont seem interested. But your reasons given for not being interested aren't very good, so I feel the compulsion to challenge them.\r\n8 RUSSIA -> ITALY: I didn't support bud cause Turkey thought I would support it, so there was no need to actually do it.\nI get your point but it's mostly a matter of preferences.\nIt took me time to build trust with Turkey so destroying it for 2 scs and a potential ally isn't good enough.\nWe really gave you a chance to avoid war with us when we asked you to move to tyr to hit G but you needed too many insurances.\nI understand that you need to survive though and I like to do something since our main target is France.\nBad thing is that I can't really think of an idea to include you in this except than moving ion-nap or ion-tun and just have adr s ven hold.\nif you could accept that we could stop bothering attacking you and move around you with fleets and armies towards France\nbut something tells me you won't like this idea.\r\n9 ITALY -> RUSSIA: The fact of the matter is, France and I can block the Med up no problem.

If so, in regards to the balance of power between the both of us he wants it.\n\nAny advice ?\r\n3 ENGLAND -> AUSTRIA: i'll supt your gal to war now for help into Mos later and, perhaps, a useful ally as the game moves on. I like long-term alliances. So liv supt gal to war as you retake rum.\nBut why did rus just disband uk?\r\n4 AUSTRIA -> ENGLAND: What is the best move regarding War:\nUk->War S Liv or\nGal->War S Liv\n\nI would day Uk->War S Liv to avoid Rum retreat in Gal .\n\nI am not sure to understand you question \"But why did rus just disband uk?\nI can see 2 russian units currently on the map (Rum and Mos). Russian's Ukraine army moved to Rumania last turn.\r\n5 ENGLAND -> AUSTRIA: Why are you moving UK to rum instead of bud so that uk can supt me next move? Bud supt by ser and UK should get it. Uk cut leave ser and bud to take rum. if you aren't leaving uk in place, what do you use to supt me into Mos?,\r\n6 ENGLAND -> AUSTRIA: i just saw the ret from uk to rum. Missed that. But I am curious how I get to mos if you aren't in UK. I'm willing to supt but would like to go for mos next year. How do I do that?\r\n7 AUSTRIA -> ENGLAND: As you said Uk can be cut as a support that's why I wanted to use it to attack Rum to improve the odds to take it back.\nMoreover, I need Ser to support hold at Bul to prevent (Rum->Bul S (BS and Con)\n\nIf the moves in Rum from Uk succeeds (Russian is down to 1 units), then I will be able to move back in Uk in spring-1905 sure 100% and be able to support Liv in Mos in Autumn-1905.\r\n8 ENGLAND -> AUSTRIA: I see your point. Don't mean to be a pain and i hate it when other players tell me what to do. When it's not your country, you can always see the best moves. OK, sup into war from gal.\r\n9 AUSTRIA -> ENGLAND: Don't worried, I like exchanging point of views regarding moves and orders .\n\nJust a slight adjustment which doesn't change the overall picture\n\nIf it's fine with you I would prefer Uk->War S Liv to avoid Rum retreat in Gal (which could be a pain in the ace to get rid of him) , I will move Gal to Rum instead.\r\n10 ENGLAND -> AUSTRIA: Well do.\r\n11 ENGLAND -> AUSTRIA: Let me know if it changes.\r\n12 AUSTRIA -> ENGLAND: On another note, more political ...\nHow should I deal with Germany on the War issue ?\nThere are no decision on how who should get it . I can pressure him to give me support. if he doesn't want to do it, I would have to lie to him saying that I will give him support.\n\nIs the War matter came up between the 2 of you ?\r\n13 ENGLAND -> AUSTRIA: Well, i don't need it, you do, but so does he. He's lost Mar and can retake, but no other builds this year. It woiuld be nice to let him have it. let me know.\r\n14 ENGLAND -> AUSTRIA: Well, i don't need it, you do, but so does he. He's lost Mar and can retake, but no other builds this year.

I can be persuaded though.\r\n18 AUSTRIA -> ENGLAND: Ok, then give him support\nIf you are still ready to work together, we will see next year how we can take Mos and War .\nJust to mention that with Mar back and the War catch he will get an additional build this year.\r\n19 ENGLAND -> AUSTRIA: I think if Ger gets War, you probably need Mos, though I may need to go through there. Still, my pieces seem committed west, so lets gove Ger war and work on getting you mos. Does that sound fair. Why don't you write Ger and offer. We can always take it back if we should decide to.\r\n20 ENGLAND -> AUSTRIA: I'll supt. You might [693252] mos or hit sev just for fun. Up to you.\r\n",

And Yes, I'll take Belgium, then help you to Holland. ~N~ ~N~ But let ME go into the EC next turn, and I'll convoy you. If [1610907] allies, we'll need to trust each other, and I think this is a good way to solidify the alliance, get over the Ec-phobia, and get invlolved down south. ~N~ ~N~ But why Italy; I thought you two had an accord, and your problem was with Austria.\r\n5 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I dont understand your suggestion...firstly you need PIC to take BEL and second which of my units did you propose to convoy ~N~ Thirdly, if you step foot in EC Ill have a sense of humour failure and will cancel our alliance ~N~ The seas in the north are mine - not negotiable. Please keep everything onshore. I have demonstrated that I will not stab you...I want to get LON into the Med ~N~ ~N~ Italy is just in the way. Im not necessarily going to fight him....just stir things up. If you build a fleet in MAR and move your army to PIE then you and I will have a VERY strong negotiating position down there :)\r\n6 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: Well, I'm sorry, but it seems the deal is a bit unequal- I have no intention of moving to the EC without your permission, but it seems to me you are violating a natural protected sea for France with the MAO. I understand WHY you are there, but by the same token- I don't want you there. I cannot go against Italy or anyone down south until I know that sea is secure- that sea to ME is like the EC. (Well, except of course for the real EC :P.) ~N~ ~N~ Anyway, teh how about the same dea altered- you go to EC, move out of MAO, and I'll convoy you from there with my fleet in the region. ~N~ ~N~ I agree with stirring things up down south, but only if I have my northern protection solidified.\r\n7 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: Listen, Im keen to be friends but you are not in a strong negotiating position so please stop dictating terms ~N~ ~N~ I can move to EC by force - I would rather pass through it with your agreement ~N~ I can protect BEL and stop you getting a build ~N~ I refused to help Italy attack you in the beginning and I helped you against Germany after he invaded you ~N~ ~N~ I have suggested a very good plan with upside for both of us but Im equally happy to plough my own furrow and leave you to your own devices\r\n8 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: I don't respond well to threats. ~N~ ~N~ Nevertheless, I am not going to start a war over failed negotiations. ~N~ ~N~ Move, and I won't stop you or break this alliance- but don't abuse this.\r\n9 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: Well that is good news - i havent made any and nor do I intend to ~N~\r\n10 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: By the way - I appreciate the sentiment :) ~N~ You will see that it will work out well for both of us. I am very trustworthy\r\n11 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: Alright, you kept your word, and we're in business. :) ~N~ ~N~ Thanks. ~N~ ~N~ See you tommorow (going out with my Theatre dept. class friends to see a play in the L.A.

I am apologetic, if that helps.\nAnd ice cream's not necessarily a bad thing!\r\n1 FRANCE -> ITALY: I should have changed my moves when I didn't get a response yesterday for a long time. But I had a long day at work and forgot about it. I didn't see that you responded until this morning after the turn had already processed.\n\nFrankly, I was concerned this was a possibility, but I opted on the side of trying to work together.\n\nOh well, this game went sideways for me the minute England stabbed Germany.\r\n2 ITALY -> FRANCE: Yeah, I started second-guessing post-tURKISH communication. Turned out they were busy over the weekend, and I'm a needy ally, apparently. I didn't mean to have lied to you the way I did. If it were pre-planned, I wouldn't have. It's not the best play style. But I had to let someone down.\n\nTurkey-italy has always been an alliance that intrigued me. The one attempt I had at it prior to this fell through when my Italy missed too many turns and dropped out. As for this game, well, if I allied with you and Russia and Germany, I pretty much would have nowhere to develop except Turkey. The way I saw it play out was that, I'd be left extremely vulnerable to an attack by you if I did make it to Turkish territories anyway.\n\nI would agree with your assessment, though. The board state changed quite a bit from that point onward.\r\n3 FRANCE -> ITALY: Turkey/Italy is a bit unconventional, but I have seen it work. You and Turkey together can control the board now and basically draw with whichever third party you choose.\n\nI'd like to finish in the draw if possible. I can be useful in containing England, and I'd be happy to cede my territory to you and live on in a small way in, let's say, Liverpool and London.\n\nBasically, if you and Turkey will allow me to be the third party to your draw, I will make myself useful in any way possible.\r\n4 FRANCE -> ITALY: I prostrate myself before you and plead for mercy! :)\r\n5 ITALY -> FRANCE: I profess - unconventional pairings are a soft spot. As are enemies to allies narratives, ha. We've had enough goes at one another for this game. I'll run by Turkey as well. However, you're my neighbour, so I don't believe it would be a problem.\n\nTo be fair, there is an infinite amount of room in my sides for Turkey to sink a cleaver in too. So who knows. The chaos has been ramping up gradually.\n\nThere is next to zero possibility you wouldn't be able to regain Marseilles in any case. Although, perhaps, would I be able to direct you towards Belgium instead? This is of course, open for discussion, and not something upon which a three-way draw deal rests upon - seeing as that would be rather coercive and unpleasant, haha.\r\n6 FRANCE -> ITALY: If I were given assurances that I would be allowed to finish in the draw (even in a reduced state), then yes, I would use Burgundy to target Belgium rather than Marseilles.\r\n7 ITALY -> FRANCE: Let me run by Turkey, yeah?\nI will do respond at the earliest convenience. And personally, yes, I would like to see us in a three-way draw.\r\n8 ITALY -> FRANCE: Thank you for the proposal. It sounds interesting.\nIn the case we agree to it, I would be able to help you against England if you're comfortable with me creeping around your borders. That way some more advancements can be made.\r\n9 FRANCE -> ITALY: Everything is on the table. Given the situation, I'm not going to be finicky about the usual territorial borders.\n\nFYI - I already messaged Turkey making the same offer I made to you. So he will know I want to survive and am prepared to help.\r\n10 ITALY -> FRANCE: Lovely. I look forward!\r\n11 ITALY -> FRANCE: All right, there ya go. Turkey's up for it too, it seems.\nI was going to move everything into Western Med to try and destroy your fleet, I confess - sorry! But I suppose we have a lot more flexibility now.\nI am hoping to keep Tunis and Mars to get some extra units to chip away at Germany and the English units there. I believe we can effectively split that quite well? You can maybe head to Belgium for the time being? I'll slowly creep around your borders to help with England.\r\n12 FRANCE -> ITALY: Heading to Belgium. Would have confirmed sooner but I just woke up.\r\n",

Be careful there\r\n1 FRANCE -> GERMANY: With Russia losing those two armies, your war on England looks a lot tougher for sure\r\n2 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Sure does.\r\n3 FRANCE -> GERMANY: Tyrolia is heading south, either to Venice or Trieste\r\n4 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Hope so.\r\n5 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Well, Russia is no longer a serious player on the western scene. I offered to support him through Scandinavia but I guess I'll be providing a distraction to England, for you.\r\n6 FRANCE -> GERMANY: well, if I attack, he'll pull back, opening a chance for the both of you. I'm hoping you can take Sweden though!\r\n7 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Maybe. We'll see how it goes. Remember to resist a quick shot at London. Liverpool is a much safer bet as long as that fleet is in the North Sea.\r\n8 GERMANY -> FRANCE: About our armies: Are we just we going to just keep this formation? Or do you have some alternative to just holding back England with them? I can't for the life of me think anything.\r\n9 FRANCE -> GERMANY: Depends on how he moves. If he takes St. P, then there will be a fleet sitting in liverpool and one in NAO by the time I arrive. A lot of this was based on Russia not folding\r\n10 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I'm afraid I'm being too defensive, now. I haven't been an example of balance anytime in this game, have I? I'm sorry.\r\n11 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Then I'll use Hel to cut North Sea's support instead of supporting Denmark? In the off-chance he tries to move from North Sea to Denmark, we'll have the option of supporting one or the other onto London or me trying for Edinburgh while you try for London.\n\nHow does that sound?\r\n12 FRANCE -> GERMANY: Well this won't really be an issue until next Spring, so I think you just do your best to take Sweden or protecting St. P so he doesn't gain and we'll go from there. It's really hard to predict how it will go.\n\nI think there's almost zero chance he attacks with North Sea this turn, so it is probably no difference if you cut north Sea or if you simply support Denmark with Heligoland and Kiel. I'm working with Austria so I'm pretty sure isn't headed to Munich. Unless you wanted to go bonkers and attack North Sea with Denmark and support from Heligo, it'd be a safe advance to Baltic Sea, and he risks Sweden if he moves too far toward St. P. As it is I think he'll move to St. P and might even take Barents (in which case he is really screwed)\r\n13 FRANCE -> GERMANY: attacking North Sea will likely put him in Denmark and London, neither of which are places we want to find him I think.\r\n14 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Oh, I'll be using Denmark to support myself to Baltic for sure.\r\n15 FRANCE -> GERMANY: why? He can't stand you out.\r\n16 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Oh right... From Skra to Baltic he'd need to move thought Denmark.\n\nThis is what happens when I change plans overnight.\r\n",

You want me out of Sev, I'm sure. You and Austria work together to eject me from Rumania, while you try to move into the Black Sea. It's a twisted world down there.\r\n2 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: Tell me about Serbia- what is keeping Austria from taking it back. And, if they are taking it back, what have you promised them?\r\n3 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: Well, I shall be moving Ukraine to Moscow to prevent you from sneaking up there. I think we can work out a trade in the future between Sev and Rumania, but I'm not sure the exact moves. I think Sev to armenia, armenia to smyrna, rumania to sev, constan to aegean and black to const would universally demilitarize our front and leave you with Rumania. Austria wouldn't give me support holds, and is taking Serbia back in the fall\r\n4 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: Tell me, why give Serbia back (not that you could hold it)? What's in it for you?\r\n5 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: Well, because its an untenable position, it makes him believe I'm on his side, he doesn't attack me, and he gave me support to Rumania\r\n6 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I mean, I could try to bounce Serbia to piss him off, if you keep going for Serbia. Or I'll support you to Bulgaria or something, but I need to know what Sev is doing\r\n7 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I'm not sure I can believe Ukraine will make the move you say it will, as it did not do so last time. And, trading back Sev for Rum sounds like a grand idea that we should explore further in 1904. But, this Autumn, since Ukraine is moving for Moscow, so shall Sevastopol. This way, we can bounce and you will be able to stay in Ukraine. I would hate to take Mossow and also be in Sevastopol - it wouldn't be good for our relationship.\r\n8 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: Tell me about your build plans for this Autumn.\r\n9 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: Most likely I will build Warsaw\r\n",

Russia is poised to take Edinburgh, I fear...\r\n1 ENGLAND -> ITALY: yes, but what can Germany or myself do,\nFrance is a double crossin' backstabber\nif we turn to fight Russia, France stabs us in the back,\nso far it's been France trying to take London\n\nlet Russia have Edinburgh, France won't get London\ni am attackin' English Channel with 2 supports this move\r\n2 ITALY -> ENGLAND: Hmmm. Let me coordinate with Austria and Germany, then, to see if I can do something useful with my armies against Russia.\r\n3 ENGLAND -> ITALY: i've done a deal with Russia\nand he may well not take Edinburgh\nthere's 6 sc's in Germany, the \"balkans of the north\"\n\ntheoretically if you & Austria combined & went on the attack\n& play'd well you should thrash Russia,\nhe is so weak in army numbers in the centre\nGermany has an army in Berlin, Austria has 4 armies, plus yours in Bulgaria\n6 armies against 3\nbut it's not theoretical,\nAustria sits on the defensive,\nhe could have captured Galicia with a support'd attack\nand you are in alliance with Russia,\nso stick with your Russian alliance\n& get your share of the carve up of Austria & Turkey\r\n4 ITALY -> ENGLAND: I'd like to carve up Austria, but I'm worried about how large Russia will grow if we do decide to split Austria. I think I'll have a talk with Russia and maybe get a sense for how open he is to splitting Austria in my favour.\n\nI'm all in favour of a strong attack, since (especially during the fall) Blitzkrieg-style attacks followed up with builds prevents an enemy from regrouping. You're still working with Germany against France, I presume?\r\n5 ENGLAND -> ITALY: well i have sort of left Germany to Russia,\nso i have to stay out of that,\nbut i did let Germany know i would be attackin' the English Channel this move,\nso he knows the French army in Belgium has no support,\n\nbut Germany let me down a bit,\nwhereas Russia has his game on top line,\nso i did a deal with Russia & i get to attack France\r\n6 ITALY -> ENGLAND: The fact that Russia has his game on top line is exactly what's bothering me, really. It's good to have a reliable ally, but not one better than you! He's good enough that I want to make sure he doesn't carry the game away.\r\n7 ITALY -> ENGLAND: This is my concern, at least; it seems like you're good enough to be able to handle him.\r\n8 ENGLAND -> ITALY: hah, i am a fool who took on England in strife,\nbut i got good value from my small resources\n\nRussia is a tricky country to play, there are 2 flanks & the centre,\ni have experiment'd with various opening moves & strategies,\n2 north & 2 south, 3 south& 1 north,\nbut i now like to open\nfleet St P to Gob\nfleet Sev to Black sea\narmy moscow to ukraine\n& army warsaw to silesia\n\ngermany & surrounding nuetral as's are the balkans of the north\ni got sick of being bounced for sweden & losing the north\n\nthats why i am also experimenting with german opening moves\nbut i figure as an opening strategy, forget Belgium in year one,\nlet France & England fight for it, best result they bounce each other,\n& maybe you stake a claim, but you only get 2 new units & the 2 year\ncontrolling Sweden is better for Germany than Belgium,\nespecially if you follow up with Norway & St P\n\nso fleet to Den (& bounce russia for sweden in fall 01 )\narmy Munich to Ruhr (& go for Holland )\narmy Berlin to Silesia & attack Warsaw\n\nget England & France to fight each other\nusing help with Belgium as a bargaining tool\n& keep them stalemated, then attack England, then France\r\n9 ENGLAND -> ITALY: i am playing russia in couple of games at the moment check them out\nand punch up maps & run through the maps\ni am old fuddy duddy who play'd on a boardgame for years with mates\nweb diplomacy is different, in that you get mixes of players with huge differences\nin ability & experience,\nit's much more anarchic in web diplomacy,\nplayers don't start & there are weird combinations of countries\ngoing into civil disorder\nso there is more opportunity & luck,\nthan in a game of 7 really good experienced players, where everyone has\na top line game going, one slip and your gone\n& playing the alliance game is critical.\n\nwith games where countries go CD, change players etc\nblocks of sc's that are occupied by units can become defensive shields\nand they can be used to entrance rivals whom you then spear\n& say rather than evenly share the idle sc's\nyou cripple the nearest major rival for those sc's\nlike put one third into chasing cd opportunities, but two thirds\ninto crippling rival nations competing for the spoils\r\n10 ITALY -> ENGLAND: I'll definitely take a look-- because of that problem that you mentioned (two flanks and the centre), Russia's been the only country I've been unable to play well. Thanks tremendously!\n\nYour proposed German moves are pretty aggressively anti-rUSSIAN, and my experience has been a bit more placid with respect to Russia in the beginning-- I'm a little uncomfortable moving against Russia when the western triangle hasn't been settled, because there's always the prospect that the western triangle could be settled against Germany's favour, and then Germany is faced with the unenviable task of fighting three countries at once. I'm quite in line with your thoughts regarding Belgium.\n\nI've played some forum Diplomacy before this, so the format is a bit more familiar to me.\n\nAs far as this game in particular goes, I'll let you know what I hear from Russia. Ensuring parity between myself and him will be absolutely crucial to our plans for Russia after Austria, Turkey, and perhaps Germany are defeated.\r\n11 ENGLAND -> ITALY: love your thinking & comments\r\n12 ITALY -> ENGLAND: Russia says that he's not moving into Edinburgh, possibly to deflect the question of SC parity between him and myself, and suggested that we include you as a minor partner in a three-way draw. I don't mind a bit, but I think we should still be a bit wary lest he grow too powerful.\r\n13 ENGLAND -> ITALY: personally i don't think Russia will attack Edinburgh\ni offer'd Russia the deal after Germany let me down a bit despite the help i gave him.\n\nRussia gets use of the North sea to attack Germany\nthats where there are 6 sc's, there's only 3 in England\ni get to fight France\nmy 3 fleets outnumber the 2 French ones.\n\nif Russia takes Ed i lose the key 3rd fleet\n\nnow i have no knowledge of what Russia will do\ni have sent him message informing him of my next moves.\nwe do not really discuss the \"german campaign\"\n\nbut ask me for a prediction, Denmark.\n\nlastly, please be very tight with what we discuss,\nplease do not discuss the \" England-russian arrangements \" with Russia.\nalso be careful that you do not let him realise that i discuss\nthe german russian stoush, Russia's strategic position etc with you\n\ni understand your notion, Russia at most needs only 18 sc's\nthat leaves 16, 8 each or some variation for the two of us\n\nbut we are a long way from end game considerations right now\r\n14 ITALY -> ENGLAND: I agree wholeheartedly with your assessment. After Russia's suggestion of a three-way draw to me, it certainly didn't seem likely that he planned to stab you. But, it's still possible (and I think likely) that he wanted to avoid discussion of the parity issue (which is understandable, and I let it rest for a while).\n\nI agree with your Denmark prediction. I was actually guessing Heligoland Bight, but Denmark seems more likely as it gives him a view into Heligoland (and Holland and Kiel with it)-- not to mention an extra SC!\n\nI understand your concern regarding what I discuss, but I assure you that I did not, and don't intend to, discuss your arrangements with him (any more than he himself is willing to share), and by no means our discussions. I'd like to think I'd have more tact than that!\n\nAs far as being away from end-game considerations, I agree, it's a far away discussion (which is why I let the issue of parity rest at the moment), but it's something I'd like to keep on the back of my mind, especially as Russia approaches the 10 SC mark.\r\n15 ENGLAND -> ITALY: that's all good stuff, and i take your point on your control of info / [832841] / chinese walls\n& tact\n\nwell after this move i will have France on the back foot,\nso he won't be able to attack Germany with much effect,\nthat will allow Germany a better chance to defend.\n\npart of my deal with Russia is that i stay out of direct involvement\nin the Russian German stoush, i simply provided use of the North sea\nand offer'd to deliver as best an offensive campaign against France\nas i could with 3 fleets\n\nonly one move ago France had England written off\nand was fantasising about his invasion plans,\nwatch me turn those wet dreams to bitter ashes over the next few moves\n\n& i think i have a better chance of landing an English army in France\nthan he does of landing one in England\r\n16 ITALY -> ENGLAND: Makes sense. Save some of France for me!\r\n",

Maybe you should use mun to bur with ruhr support instead of supporting tyr to hold. you ll surely take it since bur is obliged to attack ruhr (or else F risks losing bel with north-bel with hol and ruhr support). Then you ll be able to take bel with north-eng, bur-pic, hol-bel with ruhr support).\nI think you should start trusting me more since i have no strategical interest to attack you.\nThe fact that you fight F lets me and Turkey slowly break down Italy.

I don't know if either can work, but I think the bel to pic move is worth a try if you can offer it.\r\n1 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I'm thinking....\n\nIf Bur moves to Pic supp by Bel and Channel, we get a disband and Gas will likely land in Mar, making it impossible for him to rebuild.\r\n2 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: More in a few hours. Just got really bad news and I'm fuming. Not the best time to conduct diplomacy.\r\n3 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: real life bad news? i'm sorry.\n\nthat wont work. Paris will go to bur leaving par open for a retreat. i'm moving bur to mar w/ italian support to build a new army in munich. i'm losing bur either way so I have to shore up my own line there. but your new fleet build in liverpool will be decisive.\r\n4 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: oh damn. guess your new fleet will have to be in lon or edi since lvp will bounce in edi.\r\n5 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: one thing that would help is... after russia has to disband, you try to convince him to disband the fleet in the north. tell him he's lost scandenavia anyways and if he keeps the fleet you'll be forced to continue to work with me... but if he loses the fleet, you'll be free to attack me then. something along those lines... but that will be in the winter phase.\r\n6 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Good point. I'm still keeping it short... still fuming. Was given a job, which I officially accepted, only to see it taken away from me by the president of my union. It's a teaching position in my field of expertise for which he's got no fucking credentials ... except that he has seniority over me! I find it amazing that union rights come before the rights of the students to receive the best possible education when they attend university...\n\nSo yeah... won't talk much but will move as planned: Swe to Nor, Liv to Edi. As for the Channel, I think I'll try to force MAO. If he's moving Par to Bur and Gas to Mar, then Brest is stuck protecting Pic and MAO is available.\r\n7 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: but if you do push mao, it ends up going to NAO... so not so great. and he's more likely to protect MAO than pic from bre\r\n8 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Not a bad point...\r\n9 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: And it's actually giving me an idea! I'll leave it as a surprise for now!\nYou can count on the channel's support to Pic. from Bel.\r\n",

Are you going to convoy your army, or attack with your fleet. If I support one and you do the other, my support does not count. So be sure to tell me which one you are doing!!\r\n2 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Ben, I am going to cut-and-past a conversation I had with Sean. Please don't tell anyone else about it!\r\n3 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Here is what Sean wrote to me:\n\nYou can't get any ground from me this turn - for the sake of the people of Western Europe, I IMPLORE you to send two units to take Sweden and STP from [957554]. If you can take STP, she will be unable to build fleets in the north. Without northern fleets, you will be much safer.\n\nThis next year, she will get two (or three) builds, and I assure you one will be a northern fleet. If she can control Scandanavia, she will certainly be able to surround Germany.\n\nKeep your armies on me if you want, but I warn you that it might be too late to stop Russia if you wait until I am completely dead.\r\n4 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Here is what I said to him:\n\nYou aren't weakened enough for me to turn my attention away from you and attack someone who has been a loyal ally. But you could change that -- more on that later.\n\nI will move my fleet to Denmark so that what you suggest is an option, and if nothing else it make me feel a bit more secure about Jess attacking me. I do worry that if [508410] disintegrates, Jess may be the one picking up much of the pieces, making her a very tough adversary.\n\nBut, as I said before, you need to be weakened further before I am going to turn my back on my current allies. So here's the deal.\n\nLet Ben have Brest. I will support him with my unit from Pic. Don't abandon it, but let our attack succeed. AND.... Let me take Marseille from Bur (support your hol of Paris from Gas or some such thing).\n\nI know that means you lose 2 supply centers and will be down to 3 units. But if you play nice, I promise to let you keep those 3 until we eliminate a couple of other players. I also think I can get Ben to agree to that.\r\n5 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: If Sean chats with you, don;t let him know that I told you about our conversation -- I want to see if he tries telling you something different. I will let you know what he says to me...\r\n6 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Ben -- since I am travelling tomorrow and am not sure if/when I will get back onto a computer in the next couple of days, I put in my moves. I put them in so that my unit in Pic supports your army from Wales into Brest (ie. via convoy). I think that is the best move for you as it keeps your fleet in the EC.\r\n7 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I changed my proposal to Sean after I thought about it some more. Here is what I said to him:\n\nActually, I take that back. Let Ben have Brest, and let me take Paris (with his support) next turn. You should move to Marseilles -- your new home will be the Iberian peninsula and the riviera, and you can make forays into Italy and the Mediterranean...\r\n8 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I spoke with Sean. He said no thanks -- we will have to fight for what we get.\n\nI propose a new strategy for us. Sean can fairly easily protect Brest this turn. I think we need to focus on getting you in to MAO. That opens up so many doors. What do you think of this:\n\nYou move Irish Sea to MAO, and support that move with your EC fleet. I move Pic - Brest.. I won't get it, but if Sean uses Brest to support his hold of MAO I disrupt it. I think that guarantees that you get MAO. Next turn, if you have units in both Brest and MAO, then you should be gauranteed of picking something up from Sean.\r\n9 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Brydon wanted me to let him move to MAO because Sean will be trying to move to NAO (I know this because->) Russia will get big soon. I implore you to take one fleet - Norwegian - and attack STP. I promise I will not enter NAO if you make sure you send it east. I have no reason to lie at this point - but Russia looks to be in a VERY Good position.\n\nWould that help us If Brydon moves there or should I tell him to not do it?\r\n10 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Sean sent me that message to me about moving into Stp\r\n11 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I'm not sure about Brydon's motives. IF he sent two fleets against Spain, I think he could take it, especially if you and I are attackign Sean from the north. I am worried that Bry is really workign with Sean. I would be honest with Bry and tell him you will NOT support him into MAO, and that he should attack Spain, and sent his other fleet to attack Mars. That is our only gaurantee to beat Sean.\r\n12 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: If you are worried about Russia this turn you could move into Denmark, and I could move into Barents. That way, one us is guaranteed to get a supply center. I don't think it is that big of a deal right now though\r\n13 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Yeah... I am really torn between doing what you say, and waiting a bit longer so that we don't end up with wars on both fronts. I say we hold off for now. If Jess makes a move against us, then we team up and punish her for it...\r\n14 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Here is what I just sent to Bry:\r\n15 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Bry -- we have Sean on the ropes. We can't let up until he is down to 2-3 units at least (which means we need to take 2-3 of his supply centres). Attack! Attack! Attack! There are no American forces to save the French this time. Attack! Ben and I are doing everything we can, BUT... WE... NEED... YOUR.. HELP. Otherwise Sean might persevere and win this game. That's the worst possible outcome. Sean must die. Attack! ATTACK!! [593537]!\n09:20 PM I love my son...\n:-)\n09:25 PM Bry. Ben says you want into MAO. Forget it. The only reason for you to go there is if you are working with Sean. DON'T... WORK... WITH... SEAN (see above). Attack him from the south. Bry and I have him from the north. We will divide the spoils.\r\n16 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Ok. What do you think about Brydon's idea?\r\n17 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: It stinks! His only motive to get into MAO is to help Sean. We should try to convince him to help us work against Sean, and divide up his supply centres between the 3 of us\r\n18 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I was thinking the same thing!\r\n19 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Should my fleet at the EC move or my fleet in the Irish? I think moving from the EC would be safer because then he can't cut my support (at least from Brest he can't)\r\n20 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: keep in mind that I am going to move from Pic to Brest. I think that will stop his unit in Brest from cancelling your support from EC. Doesn't it? I am a bit confused by how some things cancel out. My worry is that if you move from EC... and if his unit in Brest actually MOVES to EC... then he could get EC and be in a threatening position next turn(?). Anyway, I will let you figure that out. I will at least try to move Pic - > brest...\r\n21 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Check out my post on global. LOL\r\n22 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Haha ya i saw it! XD\r\n",

The only questions is what to do with BUL, to attack RUM, or to cut support at SER. I guess, this hugely depends on whether we think AUS will attack BUL with support, we should not let it be disbanded.\n\nI am talking with AUS and IT and will try to find out more about the moves also.\r\n1 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: Should it matter to us who the Austrian player is? Because I think he has given himself away. And if I'm right, I think he is the best player on this site. Do you care to know, or would you rather not?\n\nItaly is not writing me at all any more. Not since I told him he won't ever get Smyrna and I'll let Austria take Bul/Con first just to deny him.\r\n2 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I have no idea about anyone's identity. Don't really care though, probably everyone here is quite good. Who is the best player, MM?\n\nI am talking with both AUS and IT, but no specific moves yet.\r\n3 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: You're right...doesn't matter who it is.\n\nI'm not getting any response from either one now.\r\n4 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I have submitted Bul-ser, Bla s Ukr-rum. Let me know if you want a change.\r\n5 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I feel compelled to say that I'm not blind to what you and Austria may be planning. You've supported him into Rum, and have built A Mos. Those are hardly anti-aUSTRIAN acts. My guess is that you're offering to help him take me down, if he'll let you take Rum with a fleet while he takes Bul, giving you an open Sev to build another fleet and take Black. Meanwhile, he moves on Venice to end up +1 for the year even though he gives up Rum. I get it.\n\nMy hope is that you'll see that I need you as an ally, and will work with you from here out. I'll vacate Black at the first reasonable opportunity, and will help you move west against Austria as best I can. The other choice, going with Austria as an ally, means he'll be at seven centers and will get the other Italian ones without doubt. His new builds as he grows will be within easy striking distance of Rum and he'll be able to march against you in a moment as I fall. Any good player of Austria is a fearsome opponent because of that ability to bring new builds against neighbors rapidly. I think you've probably seen that yourself. So, I'm asking that you choose me as your ally here. I'm the safe and reasonable choice, and I'll be loyal to you for it if you do.\r\n6 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I am ok with all this, no need to convince me. Hope you can see the before the end. Aus suggests Aeg-con, Sev-bs, Rum-bul with support from Ser, Ukr-rum.\n\nHe can be lying. Otherwise Con-bul with BS support and Syr-smy might be an idea?\r\n7 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: You make the call, and I'll go with your suggestion. I'll check back several times before deadline to see if you want me to change what I have in.\r\n8 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: well, I will move Ukr-rum with Sev support. If Aus moves as he said then my suggestion will work. However, there's a certain chance he's lying. I think he is not, but it's your centers on the line. I'm quite happy to let you take the final decision :p, you have my best guess and moves.\r\n9 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: Okay, I'll try to stand him out of Greece again, and move Con-bul with support from Black.\n\nGood luck at Rum!\r\n10 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: hmmm....maybe not. I think I may go with support for Arm-smyna. Likely he'll support Italy into Smy. But that won't affect your taking Rum, either way.\r\n11 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: ok, this also works\r\n",

You know that both of you are going to come into conflict eventually so why are you waiting to let him get stronger?\r\n5 ITALY -> RUSSIA: The silent treatment only further reinforces my hunch!\nYou are going to make a big mistake if you attack me and Germany. If you leave Turkey unchecked and make a move on your biggest neighbor then you will find yourself getting stabbed pretty quickly because France will have built up by the time I am dead and will be able to plug the MED, giving Turkey limited options for expansion, meanwhile Germany is not in bad shape and could hold you down for a good few years, especially depending on how much France is willing to cooperate with you.\n\nIf Turkey makes a move on RUM this Spring and you make a stab on Germany then you are done.\r\n6 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Sorry I don't mean to be silent. I have had a big project at work which is taking up all my time.\r\n7 RUSSIA -> ITALY: I haven't set anything up to be honest. In fact you have been the main organizer in the south.\r\n8 RUSSIA -> ITALY: And I was under the impression that things have been running according to your plans.\nI think you are worried because Turkey built a fleet, while you built an army. That would suggest to me, that really it is Turkey you are annoyed with.\r\n9 RUSSIA -> ITALY: And I was under the impression that things have been running according to your plans.\nI think you are worried because Turkey built a fleet, while you built an army. That would suggest to me, that really it is Turkey you are annoyed with.\r\n10 RUSSIA -> ITALY: May I suggest you try to look at things in a more positive way. Rather than projecting your fears, encourage me to play the moves you would like me to play because it will benefit us both.\nYou did a great job of convincing me to switch attacks from Turkey to Austria. If you recall you were actually berating me for moves I had not actually played yet. But then when you actually explained your plans and the mutual payoff you got me to do what you wanted me to do. You can still do that.\r\n11 RUSSIA -> ITALY: I think there were too many \"actuallys\" in the above paragraph. Lol.\r\n12 RUSSIA -> ITALY: Let's make this clear. I have not decided to attack either you or Germany. We have been focusing on Austria, and that is what my focus will remain for this turn.\nIf we can come up with a great plan then I look forward to it.\r\n13 RUSSIA -> ITALY: I take it Germany will back off? That would be a good start.\r\n14 RUSSIA -> ITALY: That would mean you can take Trieste. Although it might be hard to hold vie as well.\r\n15 ITALY -> RUSSIA: I do not know exactly what Germany will do, but it would seem that you have had regular contact with him this phase so you should probably know that answer for yourself.\n\nI play the game with a few to what moves will bring about solos for countries. If you want to be a contender to win then attacking me in this turn will limit you to a draw as you will never truly be able to defeat Turkey when I am gone without another power making an attack on you.\nYes I am annoyed with Turkey, he promised to build an army, at least that build could have be used to attack either of us, a fleet shows blatantly which direction he will be going in and I can only assume that you must have in some way influenced this build during your press. I have nothing against influencing other players, that is not a cause for war, in fact it is a good move by you as it means you have the choice of 2 potential allies, Turkey has already picked his side. That is how I read it at least.\n\nTurkey has told me that he and I are going to engage in some manoeuvres in order to fool you into thinking he is on your side. My hunch is that he is really on your side but he did note that you are unlikely to have a double support on RUM in the Spring time, so I guess it could either way with him. However he has shown his cards so now we have the golden opportunity to continue working together in peace. Quickly finishing off Turkey should be top priority as France and Germany are both in healthy positions and England will not last long. Who knows if they will go head to head after that? If not then you could be in trouble from Germany if you choose to ally with Turkey. Additionally if you had it in your mind to stab Germany I would suggest that this year would be a bad idea, as you will be reducing your own options and giving some control back to Turkey by doing it.\r\n16 RUSSIA -> ITALY: I agree that stabbing Germany would be a bad idea. And yes I want to keep my options open.\nGenerally speaking Italy/Russia alliance had big advantages. So I am aware.\nBut natually I don't want to fight Turkey unless I have help.\r\n17 ITALY -> RUSSIA: Well don't make any moves against me this turn and you will have all the assistance I can give.\r\n",

All I ask is to survive the game.\r\n6 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: I have talked to Austria about Germany Italy and France.\r\n7 TURKEY -> ENGLAND: Okay. The key to this will be coordination. I'm not Taking St. Pete's, better for you to bounce him out - you need the units. Instead, I'm going gamble on a move to warsaw. I'll still keep moscow, and this way Germany will lose an army for at least one turn. Where else would he go if not North? He has few units in his rear, and it will out flank him.\r\n8 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: Ok my fleet will move back. He is very stretched out and you can flank him with your armies to the south. You are right about working together closely and I see no problems with that.\r\n9 TURKEY -> ENGLAND: for the time being, I've been able to feed Italy, France, and Germany misinformation.\r\n10 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: Good this will work well for us.\r\n11 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: I will keep France and Germany as tied up as I can in the north.\r\n12 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: Barent is going back to St.pete and I'm hitting the Channel.\r\n13 TURKEY -> ENGLAND: good.

I think with the limited time it would be hard to turn things around, if you were getting killed, through negotiations though.\r\n2 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: yeah. well, that's how it goes with the boardgame too, in my experience. whereas on here you can whittle away at someone turn after turn and finally get them to turn. or just sew enough doubt about their alliance.\n\nanyway, i'm going to take at least another SC off germany before i consider stabbing france. in the meantime, fine by me if you keep attacking russia.\r\n3 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: i'll take stp when the time is right.\r\n4 TURKEY -> ENGLAND: Well it certainly works for you if I attack Russia, he told me that all you can offer him is safety if he goes hard against me.\r\n5 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: well i can't very well help him attack you =P\n\nand yes, it does help me. i wish france hadn't built that fleet. it makes things so much more complicated. it helps italy though.\r\n6 TURKEY -> ENGLAND: Yes, France told me you were less than pleased.\n\nLog on as stratagos, so we can continue that more time sensitive discussion.\r\n7 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: ah ok. one sec\r\n8 TURKEY -> ENGLAND: FACT: Games with more stabs are more fun.\r\n9 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: lol, i agree. but even more fun are games with more alliance-stab-alliance structures =P\r\n10 TURKEY -> ENGLAND: What is that exactly?\r\n11 ENGLAND -> TURKEY: we re allies. i stab you. we fight. then we become allies again. then you stab me. then we fight, and so on.\r\n12 TURKEY -> ENGLAND: Ah yes. I agree. And trust me, I'd stab you good if you were anywhere near me, but its just not meant to be.

If the situation changes, you can get back to me about it, but there is no way I'm going to accelerate the upcoming war with Turkey, especially considering that my attack would fail.\r\n13 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: no problem....you'll have war on two fronts (maybe three) ~N~ Best of luck :)\r\n14 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: I'm only trying to delay the inevitable...\r\n",

I will move the Nor to Barents and North Sea to Nor SEA with the EC to the North Sea, only if you support that move to the North Sea. Let me know your thoughts?\r\n2 GERMANY -> FRANCE: OK. I will move Mun - Sil and Ruh - Mun, can you support the Ruh - Mun portion? I can support your move back into Nth in the Fall.\r\n3 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I will support you into MUN from RUHR.\r\n4 FRANCE -> GERMANY: Russia tells me he's falling back, I just laughed at him. Not sure he will screw up 3 turns in a row (last turn, his destroys, and this turn). We need to get your fleets positioned to take out the Baltic Sea. Not sure when, but he will loose at least 1-2 Sc's and hopefully he destroys a fleet up here. At least we can hope he does.\r\n5 GERMANY -> FRANCE: He tells me the same thing, \"folding\" back...like you I have been surprised with his decisions. Agree that I need to get into the Baltic and push through into the center.\r\n6 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Cancel the support into Mun. I am going to try and rotate things a bit more up north, so Berlin will move to Sil.\r\n7 FRANCE -> GERMANY: OK, I will change that to a support MUN instead.\r\n8 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Thanks!\r\n9 FRANCE -> GERMANY: NP, this has been fun thus far.\r\n10 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Absolutely. No Cds to speak of and your negotitations which led to a game altering stab--just what a games supposed to be. OK, Russia's bonehead taking of Ven to stop Turkey cold may have played into it as well, but I have to admit that I sometimes find myself getting lazy about writing the \"bad guys\" once alliances have become so public and obvious. I generally make a commitment to the end and figure the other side will as well. This one just goes to show me...\r\n",

Tell me what you think.\r\n2 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I'd prefer the first moves, since the latter will dislodge my army if it fails. Support Ruhr to Kiel, you support hold Munich?\r\n3 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: Yes I prefer those moves as I desperately need a fleet build in Marseilles. I assume Italy is going to try to disband Tuscany? Its and odd situation down there, things are starting to slow down in a big way and Turkey dying isn't helping things.\r\n4 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I know. It's trouble.

I'm starting thinking this might be the case, and I'd like to hear your opinion about it.\r\n6 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: no, i don't think so. i thnk people who throw hissy fits when they get killed are more likely to get killed. b/c they are annoying, and no one wants to play with someone annoying.\r\n7 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I noticed only now the fleet in Lvp; worried F won't be able to hold?\r\n8 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: yup.\r\n9 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: would you like to discuss with me about the current situation and what might follow, or you'd rather wait my departure for that?\r\n10 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: no, i'm fine to discuss but i have to go do my weekend things right now. what are your thoughts? i've reply when i get back online later.\r\n11 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I think that now F will have to move back to MAO to hold that line; it's a bit of a setback, and if T and Italy play properly they might be able to force Lyo. If F can manage to retreat Lyo to Spa and Spa to Por the southern line will hold indefinitely, and after T gets Sev T+I will have 6 fleets who won't have much use.\n\nA is doomed, and will probably die this year, next if R decides that saving him is more important than saving himself.\n\nAfter A dies Italy will move north and try to protect me or (if I die earlier) try to set up some kind of stalemate line; it might work only if T brings R down pretty fast (Ank to Arm might be a good idea, I wonder why he tries to move to Cos), because you and F have more armies there right now.\n\nSo I believe you won't stab F because now you cannot block MAO yourself, and if T+I are fast enough I might survive a little like jb did in our first live game. But what will be decisive won't be me but Russia. The longer he survives, the more chances you and F have to turn the tide and push into the Balkans.\r\n",

If you can take STP, she will be unable to build fleets in the north. Without northern fleets, you will be much safer.\n\nThis next year, she will get two (or three) builds, and I assure you one will be a northern fleet. If she can control Scandanavia, she will certainly be able to surround Germany.\n\nKeep your armies on me if you want, but I warn you that it might be too late to stop Russia if you wait until I am completely dead.\r\n1 GERMANY -> FRANCE: You aren't weakened enough for me to turn my attention away from you and attack someone who has been a loyal ally. But you could change that -- more on that later.\n\nI will move my fleet to Denmark so that what you suggest is an option, and if nothing else it make me feel a bit more secure about Jess attacking me. I do worry that if [508410] disintegrates, Jess may be the one picking up much of the pieces, making her a very tough adversary.\n\nBut, as I said before, you need to be weakened further before I am going to turn my back on my current allies. So here's the deal. And remember the meta-game plan that I think you agree with.\n\nLet Ben have Brest. I will support him with my unit from Pic. Don't abandon it, but let our attack succeed. AND.... Let me take Marseille from Bur (support your hol of Paris from Gas or some such thing).\n\nI know that means you lose 2 supply centers and will be down to 3 units. But if you play nice, I promise to let you keep those 3 until we eliminate a couple of other players. I also think I can get Ben to agree to that.\r\n2 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Actually, I take that back. Let Ben have Brest, and let me take Paris (with his support) next turn. You should move to Marseilles -- your new home will be the Iberian peninsula and the riviera, and you can make forays into Italy and the Mediterranean...\r\n3 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Just remember: There are no Americans in this game. I hope you choke on your baguette. :-)\r\n4 GERMANY -> FRANCE: And you could have been the French leader who brought peace and prosperity to the Iberian Penisula and the Riviera. It will takes decades to recover from the destruction we will reap upon it....\r\n5 GERMANY -> FRANCE: You will drown in your own blood. Blah, blah, blah...\r\n6 FRANCE -> GERMANY: The last breath I take will be as sweet as any other so long as it is drawn at your expense.\r\n7 FRANCE -> GERMANY: Jokes aside, here is my offer to you:\n\nBen takes Iberia, and you take nothing. I remain as a [1499748] power who sits around and doesn&t really do anything. If you&d like, you can even have my armies split up (one goes east to help V. Russia, one goes south to help V. Italy, and one stays at home to guard home).\n\nYou get no Scs out of it, but Ben gets some, which fits into your \"Metagame\" objective, does it not?\r\n8 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I'm interested. But it's bedtime. And Brydon is a wild card to me. How can you or I guarantee Ben will get the Iberian Pen? We will talk at 7:00 am tomorrow. Packing is done...\n\nWhen are we returning to Ben Nevis? I propose summer of '16 (when you complete your undegrad. With Curt this time.\r\n9 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Did you like the Global monologue? I expected a more valiant response ... :-)\r\n",

Is there anything I can do to make you more comfortable leaving it open. Probably not but I thought I'd ask.\r\n2 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: you could move bulgaria to cons, leave bulg open ...and then every turn i move serbia into bularia and you move cons into bulgaria. ~N~ ~N~ but the soon to be fleeet in the black sea needs to move to the med right? so we can set up some safe but using less units border system after the fleet has moved away.\r\n3 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: england and russia have a much better system that us, look at norway and st petes, free of units. can we work towrds that?. if you have one unit in cons and i have one unit in either serbia or rumania(but not both) then we will both free up a unit to do other stuff\r\n4 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: I would like to move the fleet from Greece at some point, so it might make sense to leave Serbia, Bulgaria, Greece free of units. You have a unit in Rumania and I have units in Seva and Con. ~N~ ~N~ I'm withdrawing from Con. this turn. Next turn I should (baring something unforseen) withdraw from Bulgaria.\r\n5 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: if you move the army to sevas, next turn you could make a move on moscow, i will help if you help me with warsaw\r\n6 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: I want to discuss with you end game scenarios. a 2 way draw is impossible for all players, draws cannot be 2 way, it is too easy for one player, especially a stabber like england to simply grab an extra sc and win the game, ~N~ now the way the league points are set up if for example you and england go for a 2 way draw and england grabs that one extra sc to give him 18 to your 16 sc then he will get ALL the points and you will be on zero points, same with poor germnay. at the end of the 5 games IF you are on the same number of points as another player then the league will calculate your SC gained in the 5 games. so in that limited sense having lots of Sc and surviving is good. but it is in a very limited way . ~N~ ~N~ england is going for the win, he will crush france this year and next, russia and germany are on the way out. that leaves you, me england and italy. italy will try to talk you into a 2 way draw but i would be VERY careful about that, 2 way draws are next to impossible, it would be very much in his interest to ask you for that then go for the win. however 3 way draws are much easier to make. i propose we use our alliance to finish off russia and italy and present england with a strong united front that he cannot break into. then give him the chance for a 3 way draw. 4 way if [151052] is to be included in it. ~N~ ~N~ If you stab me i think england will win the game and if i stab you then i think england will win the game.\r\n7 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: Nice job taking Munich. ~N~ ~N~ I completely agree on all points. If nothing else Russia and England have (at least temporarily) a strong relationship so we'd be at serious disadvantage if we each tried to go at it alone. ~N~ ~N~ I'm moving my black sea fleet to Con this next turn. I know that it is somewhat of a risk on your part, but if you could move the army from Rumania to Ukraine that would be huge. I'm sure me and Russia will bounce in Moscow this next turn we could take (I think) warsaw or moscow next year if there is any army in Ukraine. ~N~ ~N~\r\n8 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: Should we call off hostilities with [151052] and try to get him to fight England? Should we continue to keep pressure on him?\r\n9 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: keep pressure maybe. i cant see [151052] fighting england just yet, they are too far away and also you will have all these fleets, best use for them is in the med sea. i hope you plan to build fleets from now on. if you take moscow and i warsaw this year or next will you build another fleet and i will build an army in vienna?\r\n10 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: [151052] wants (well according to him) to make a deal with england. i dont know if this is a lie or not. he told me england was quite hostile and pushy a few years ago. but i think there is a lot of reasons for england and italy to become partners. england would be glad that italy can stop your navies and they also can team up to take france out. we may ne dup with a four way draw- italy and england and austria and turkey. russia will be stabbed by england when we take moscow i think. england wont want turkish armies near his safe swedish and norway provinces.\r\n11 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: end up\r\n12 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: i will need to think about rumania. might be better off for me to use galica. i get a build this year due to munich so i will build in either budapest or vienna\r\n13 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: I will build primarily fleets from now one (I can't guarantee that I will never build an army again.) ~N~ ~N~ It would be very useful if you would move to Ukraine, although I understand why you wouldn't. I'm not sure if I would do it if I was in position.\r\n14 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: you will move black sea to cons and smyna to armenia and sevas to moscow? then i will build in [246553] and move to galica. galica to move to ukraine. ~N~ ~N~ my rumania can support my own unit into ukraine. that way if he builds in moscow or warsaw then he cannot block my advance into ukraine. i am aiming to get warsaw this year if possible.\r\n15 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: Yes A(SEV) ->MOS, F(BLA)-> CON, A(SMY)->ARM. ~N~ ~N~ I was thinking about moving F(ION)->APU and F(GRE)->ION but since Italy and England are probably working together my guess is that Italy will try to retake the Ionian this next turn. I will hold off any advances in the med until the third fleet gets down there.\r\n",

Any ideas for what I should do with all my other units?\r\n1 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: yes if you do that, i will consider nothing has happened and we will get back to our former alliance\nas for the other units, you are not in an easy situation, i can talk germany into refraining from attacking you, we are very closely allied so he will probably listen to me\nbut the rest seems uneasy, i think rumania is lost but you should put a lock on any turkish progression, if I were him id try to circle you by moving to albania, so you could move ionian to albania with serbian support and naples to ionian\ni do not think turkey will have a go at ionian because he expects you to support it\nrussia may use all his units to get rumania, so if i get germany good, then vienna has nothing to fear\r\n2 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Alright, try to talk the Germans out of attacking me, and you will have my full cooperation, moving out of your centers while I go defend myself from the Turks. Meanwhile, that gives you chance against England and France -- a good deal all around.\r\n3 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I will now send a message to Germany.\r\n4 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Thank you very much. Let's see if we can't surprise this Juggernaut with some unity.\r\n5 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: in hindsight it is a real pity for the two of us that you stabbed me, we would have had a much stronger position by now. I was not afraid of the stab because I knew it was suicide for the two of us if you would do so, but I should have made my point louder back then to avert it.\nAnyhow, we still stand a chance in this game, but we need to play smartly.\r\n6 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Agreed. I didn't count on you being able to pull Germany in, and I thought I could turn one of Turkey and Russia to my side. I always seem to forget that armies can move through tyr thoguh.\r\n7 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: if the two alliances GER-ITA and RUS-TUR were not that solid, your stab would have worked, it was very smart, even though I kinda expected it after your insistence on retreating to ionian. I should have made clear a retreat to ionian was an act of war though.\r\n8 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: Yeah I was trying to shake things up -- right now, you and I seem to be the only ones shaken though. It was a gamble that didn't work out.\r\n9 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: this juggernaut is very dangerous\nEngland thinks he is playing smartly by keeping france alive, but it would have been much better for him to do what I suggested, ie take paris with my support while i would have taken portugal with his support\nHe would have gotten belgium soon and builds to defend against russia, while i would be a stronger partner to contain turkey\nHe said he agreed to it and instead of this stabbed me, but once again not all stabs are good!\nDo you think you have any leverage to convince england to ally with us and finish france with my help?\r\n10 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: England will finish France if he believes it will give him the builds to fend off Russia. At this point, I think England will do whatever it takes to survive the Russian onslaught.\r\n",

I'd really rather you hadn't built those fleets either. But here we are. Perhaps, with a right set of circumstances, old (and new) grudges can be put to rest?\r\n6 FRANCE -> ITALY: Oh, I am certainly not accusing you of doing anything that was unprovoked. I provoked the hell out of you. Like, seriously, I'm not sure I could have possibly been more aggressive toward you.\n\nBut, the England stab changed the game for me, as I expect the Turkish stab has changed things for you.\n\nI am certainly up for putting grudges to rest and forming new alliances.\r\n7 ITALY -> FRANCE: Haha, I'm glad we're on the same page. I haven't gone any easier on you.\n\nYou're quite right. We're in similar fleets, it seems. Turkey hasn't provoked me directly and even circumvented Trieste with Serbia, and he is responsible for me getting as far as I have, so there's natural reluctance there to do anything without being provoked. Simultaneously, Russia going down may place me in an uncomfortable position and having some back-up is never a bad thing.\n\nI'm still tossing up between retreating or trying for Munich since Germany's feeling a little bit hopeless.\r\n8 FRANCE -> ITALY: Turkey will be at a minimum of 8 Scs at the end of the year. Turkey could then continue to target Russia for another year or so. But it will not ignore an empty Trieste or Vienna much longer than that, if even that long. You are asking for trouble if you leave those Scs unguarded.\r\n9 FRANCE -> ITALY: I'd discourage an attack on Germany, as I think weakening Germany further only helps England.\r\n10 ITALY -> FRANCE: That's true. I won't be leaving Trieste unguarded for certain. I agree and understand about Germany. However, I would be surprised if Silesia doesn't go for Berlin this turn as well & Germany offered both me and Russia his territory following the little jab from England. I'll maybe have a chat with Russia.\r\n11 FRANCE -> ITALY: I'm trying to encourage Germany and Russia to work together to take Sweden from England. I'm hoping Germany doesn't completely fold, because I think together they can resist England.\n\nSo far, I have not heard back on my efforts at persuasion.\r\n12 FRANCE -> ITALY: Russia has indicated that it is working with Germany against England. So, I'd like to give them space to do that.\r\n13 ITALY -> FRANCE: This is turning into quite a complex game, haha. Everyone is an invaluable ally all of a sudden.\n\nI'll sleep on figuring out how to best re-position my units. Particularly the fleet-y ones.\r\n14 FRANCE -> ITALY: The Wicked Witches double stab has certain opened up numerous possibilities for all of us.\r\n15 ITALY -> FRANCE: This is very true. I'm uncertain about how to reposition my fleets. I don't suppose you'd want to give a go at destroying the Tyrr Sea fleet this turn?\r\n16 ITALY -> FRANCE: Wicked Witches is a strangely apt title that makes more and more sense the longer I think about it, hahaha.\r\n17 ITALY -> FRANCE: Basically, how are you looking to arrange your fleets this turn/what are the moves you've set down?\n\nAnd my suggestion of trying to destroy the Tyrr Sea fleet is a bit absurd at this point - sorry. I'm going a little bit mental trying to figure it all out. I don't suppose you'd be able to return/shuffle a fleet into the WM again this turn?\r\n18 FRANCE -> ITALY: I don't think I can cover the Western Med while also protecting Tunis.\n\nI also have to worry about covering Marseilles, and I am not yet 100% convinced that you and Turkey aren't still working together.\r\n19 ITALY -> FRANCE: No worries, no worries - that's a valid concern. I don't mind - I'm unsure what to do with my fleets in the meantime or even in the long-term if we're to work together.\nTechnically, our fleets combined would outweigh Turkey's, however, yours are going to be occupied with defence as well.\r\n20 ITALY -> FRANCE: Just your typical post-upheaval antsy feelings, haha.\r\n21 FRANCE -> ITALY: Tunis could support an attack on the Tyrrhenian or the Ionian. I could offer either without compromising my defense.\n\nIf you would like me to enter an order supporting one of your units to one of those sea zones, let me know.\r\n22 FRANCE -> ITALY: My preference would be the Ionian, as that would force Turkey back from my border. But let me know your thoughts.\r\n23 ITALY -> FRANCE: I may just hold things for the time being. Unfortunately, an attack on Ionian will result in a retreat to the Adriatic, which poses further problems for me as Venice shall be open and I have no Scs.\nGoing to the Tyrr is preferable for me, but less so for you and would probably warrant a corresponding hop into the Adriatic anyway.\r\n24 ITALY -> FRANCE: Do you have qualms about being in the Tyrrhenian later on? I'm naturally reluctant as my home centres would be exposed. However, it may be a necessity depending on how things fly.\r\n25 ITALY -> FRANCE: Or sail, as things would have it.\r\n26 FRANCE -> ITALY: I have no opposition to taking the Tyrhennian.\r\n27 ITALY -> FRANCE: Well, I do hope I won't be seeing the wrong side of that knife here, hey. It doesn't make much sense for you to stab with the rest of your units so far & Turkey will be most likely the victor in that situation. I'm considering being a little risky by supporting you in with Rome and shuffling Naples to Apulia.\r\n28 ITALY -> FRANCE: Rather than holding, I may just give Pied a go at Gol to see whether anything lands.\r\n29 ITALY -> FRANCE: Any thoughts/inputs are welcome, always. As beneficial for a good alliance.\r\n30 ITALY -> FRANCE: I am unfortunately headed off for the night & let me know, though, and I'll lock in my moves before time tomorrow.\r\n31 FRANCE -> ITALY: The problem with advancing Tunis to the Tyrhennian now is that it leaves Tunis vulnerable to Turkish attack.\n\nWhile I am agreeable to taking the Tyrhennian, that would need to be at some point in the future. Not his turn.\r\n32 FRANCE -> ITALY: I mean \"this turn.\"\r\n33 FRANCE -> ITALY: Not this turn. \"His\" was a mistype.\r\n34 ITALY -> FRANCE: All right, yes no worries. Totally understood.\r\n35 ITALY -> FRANCE: All right, yes no worries. Totally understood.\r\n36 ITALY -> FRANCE: Actually if you're still around!!\nLet me know if you can support Rome into the Tyrrh Sea this turn?\r\n37 FRANCE -> ITALY: Yep, will do.\r\n38 FRANCE -> ITALY: Order is entered and readied.\r\n39 FRANCE -> ITALY: Sorry, for multiple posts.\r\n40 ITALY -> FRANCE: No worries, haha. I'm experiencing a lot of multi-post glitches too.\nI've set it down for:\nPie -> Gol\nRome -> Tyrr\nNaples support Rome -> Tyrr\n\nCheers and thank you. Are you going to be okay with the potential of a Western Med retreat?\r\n41 FRANCE -> ITALY: If it helps us form a working partnership, yeah, I'm fine with that retreat.\r\n42 ITALY -> FRANCE: Following this, I will be moving Piedmont back to Tuscany. Right now, it's not super mobile obviously since I need it to cut Gol support.\r\n43 ITALY -> FRANCE: I would recommend Spain to Western Med if/where possible, though I understand your unwillingness there too.\r\n",

Both would be mildly unfriendly, but if you cover it with MUN and move BAL back to KIE with support, I will assume our alliance is back on. If you cover BER with MUN and attack SWE again, I will assume you have thrown away our friendship.\r\n1 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: Similarly, if you cover BER with BAL and use MUN agai St France I will see that as friendly ... Especially if you take some action against England as well.\r\n2 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: Hello Sir :)\nGlad to see we still can build something together :)\n\nAt present I hesitate on the best way to protect myself...\n\nI hope Italy isn't joining the party :/\nHe was supposed to move against France and turned back then moves north.\nAre they aiming for Oktoberfest in Munich? Lol.\n\nCould you consider to support hold in Munich?\nOf course Den is staying put and Baltic is gonna defend my home centers.\nAs I said it was all a show to get help from England.\n\nFrom here the plan is to survive, fight France and assist you the best I can in the north as I've done in the past ;)\r\n3 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: OK. I am eager to see what \"defend home centers looks like. Meanwhile I will leave you the choce of how to handle Berlin. I am hoping we can resume our alliance.\r\n4 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: I'm moving Baltic back home or I support Den is what it's gonna look like :)\nThere's the Munich issue.\nFrance is hostile and it's no news. I believe he made alliance with Italy.\nIt all depends on the agreement between France and Italy for me to deal with it alone.\nIf France is supposed to move in I can assault Burgundy. If it's Italy I could use some support in there.\nThe thing is it's autumn so I don't want to lose a SC.\nSo to sum up, could you please support hold the unit in Munich?\r\n5 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: I just realized I forgot to phrase it properly:\nI am hoping too we can resume our alliance :)\r\n6 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: On my iphONE again so missing everything before \"Italy ...\" If you ask me to support MUN that takes away my move to BER and leaves me open to further aggressive moves. If you had stayed home, I would be more than happy to support MUN per your request for help, but your spring moves are what has put your SC at risk. I will try to get Italy to focus on Austria which may work.\r\n7 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: Considering what I've done I understand you're not willing to trust me much here. I'm usually pretty good at taking my responsabilities and accepting the consequences of my decisions, but...\nDelay may be lethal. I consider I have 1 day 5 hours to regain your trust :)\n\nIf I lose Munich I'll make for a very poor ally.\nWhat good will my armies do, fighting in a line? ;p\n\nAlso you say you're worried about being open for more aggressive moves...\nOnce again mate, I was just in desperate need to get the upper hand against France.\nI got it now, if I lose Munich it'll be lost again, and most likely for good.\nFrance is wounded. I made him lose a SC and a unit.\nIf he recovers I'm toast, he'll grow and you'll find yourself facing a big tough France allied to Italy when you're finished with England and Austria.\n\nI ain't saying you need me at all cost. I'm just saying you don't risk anything supporting Munich and unleashing me against France ;)\r\n8 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: OK -- I finally have my computer back and have re-read the entire exchange. Unfortunately, it was not much comfort. You had English support in Belgium regardless of whether you move to Baltic & Sweden, so those moves were unnecessary. If I had not planned to move to Sweden to support you, it would have cost me a supply center there, and I am still vulnerable in the fall. Especially if the english support is more permanent. You had a chance to kill the English F HEL and you did not take it. If you had done that, you could now have taken North Sea (as I cut support from F EDI) and we woudl be \"on plan\" as far as England goes (with the added advantage that you now own BEL). Maybe you want to re-establish our alliance. I hope so. But I will not put Sweden at risk. That means my A SIL is not available to support MUN this fall. You can choose F BAL->BER, A MUN->BER or both. I will lobby Italy to move on Austria, but if you lose the SC, it will simply be a balance for the gain in Belgium. And in any case, it is your own fault. If your fleet had moved to HEL instead of BAL I would support A MUN without hesitation. I do not throw away allies easily, but you need to make moves (not promises) to restore your status as ally.\r\n9 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: Not cool. Really.\n\nAs I said it was a sping move, the CS wasn't lost to you.\nI was trying to save my butt with France armies and English fleets on my doorstep.\nYour back up would have help me hold a bit longer but not to gain ground.\nI had to negociate with England since France is [1137837] me from the 1st move.\n\nAnd you know what?\nI think we could also consider you lacked good \"ally spirit\" in the first place...\nI help you gain Norway (bloody SC and key to the North) and the next move you refuse to help me get North Sea because you want more and more cover for yourself.\nThis is when England rushed Heligoland and North Sea.\nYou say I should have moved Heli? It was autumn, I was protecting my SC so Kiel was supporting Holland.\nI help you get Norway and you let me down afterwards is what happened.\n\nAnd you try to make me feel guilty because I made a desperate move?\nYou didn't lose anything, you're not threatened anywhere.\nYou can ensure Sweden is safe without blackmailing me.\nMove Nor-swe support from Finland. Move Norwegian Sea - Norway in case North Sea goes there. [940221] is safe.\n\nAh well, I ain't gonna crawl and beg.\nMy orders will be Baltic - Berlin, Denmark holds, Munich holds.\n\nThis is Diplomacy.\nMaybe you used me as a magnet for hostile armies.\nIt's been working well.\nYou own the map so far.\nEngland is isolated, France and Italy are gonna spend a little time taking me down.\nTurkey is taking care of the south.\nYou may even get a solo out of it.\nNot the kind of solo I'm proud of for myself (I prefer using careful choosen words than just betraying) but there are some that are happy with petty victories. Are you one of them? Really?\r\n10 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: You have some sequence issues wrong. Idid not say you should have moved to HEL in the autumn instead of supporting HOL. I said you should have moved to HEL instead of BAL this recently past turn and supported that from DEN instead of bouncing me in SWE. Meanwhile, you now have less security than before and I have to give up position to protect SWE (or risk anther \"crazy plan\" from you).\n\nAnd as for your rant about \"carefully chosen words\", how did your carefully chosen words about keeping \"BAL as a DMZ\" and \"no stabbing\" figure into your \"crazy plan\"? Again ... both your position and mine would be much better without the latest lurch toward me. But as you say, this is Diplomacy. And the fact remains that there are many advantages in restoring our alliance. The moves you suggest will certainly restore some trust.\r\n11 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: Yes I could have moved in Heli to counter England.\nBut without the negociation he would have moved in Denmark with support from North Sea and I would have lost it so my only chance was support Den-kiel to no gain, still stuck like hell.\n\nThis would have been defensive once again.\nEven if it had been a success I was still tied up and stuck by France's bum rush.\nI had to find offensive support.\n\nThe option was to cut a deal with England who's wary of you: I asked him 1 support in Belgium in exchange he asked me to turn my cloak against you.\nI decided to make a show of it.\nI agreed and stabbed, yeah but with a plastic spoon.\nIt was spring. I knew you could recover the SC.\nI knew we could talk.\nThe goal wasn't to break our agreement.\nIt was to pretend I did in order to hurt France and breach his line.\n\nIf I lose Munich, France will recover and I'll most likely collapse, because I won't be able to hold longer under his pressure. Especially if Italy joins.\n\nYour support in Munich won't cost you much.\nAnd if you worry about Scandinavia, well you can secure it.\nYes it may imply you give up position. But you're not in danger to lose a SC.\nIt's a simple choice between a little delay in the north or losing an ally craving to give hell to France and hold off Italy while you fight England.\r\n12 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: I understand the argument and will take it under consideration. I still think, though, that you are confusing the negotiations with England (which got him to help you into BEL) with the actual orders submitted (which could have benefited from England's support while also positioning yourself to attack him). The move to HEL would not have been defensive.\n\nBut it is done. And as I said, moves consistent with our alliance will reestablish it.\r\n13 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: The idea was to show good will in spring to be safe in autumn.\nNo more harm would come from France and England then so my strike would be efficient and France pulled down.\nFor some reason I was confident you wouldn't mind ;p\r\n14 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: Maybe if you had warned me it would have been better? Anyway, I think things can be patched up.\r\n15 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: Yeah it was last minute panick I confess.\nBut no permanent harm done I trust :)\r\n16 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: Trust is the key. We'll see how things work out this turn.\r\n",

I asked them not to because I made a promise to you. They still want to kill you. What I got them to agree to is that as long as you do not make any clearly attacking moves, we would not attack you. But if you made an attacking move, we would all jump all over your (soon to be...) corpse. They took your last set of moves as attacking... I had to convince them that they could be seen as defensive, so we should restrain ourselves. If you move to Belgium, their leashes will snap under the pressure and I will go along with the feast on your corpse (lest I be next...).\r\n5 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I AM moving to Belgium. If you stay out, then chances are you will live to call a Draw with Ben, Tyrus and I. If you move to Belgium, I frankly don;t like your chances... :-)\r\n6 FRANCE -> GERMANY: That's absurd. It's a defensive move I am making, and you (and them) should know it.\r\n7 FRANCE -> GERMANY: If you're genuinely trying to work with me, then hold your fleet in Holland. If I take Belgium, I'd be inviting you and Ben to attack me anyhow. You've been honest and I trust you to not attack me first, but if your units get closer and closer, I'm not going to take chances. If I go down, I'll make it a long, bitter fight.\r\n8 FRANCE -> GERMANY: But I don't trust Ben as much. He's lied to me roughly every turn until the last few, and now that he's got the Channel again, I suspect he's going to give in to temptation and attack. Forgive me for reacting to his aggression.\r\n9 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I disagree with your assessment. Me being in Bel is like you being in Pic. You are already in Pic. I am just being defensive to match your level of defensiveness.\r\n10 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I have more cause to want to protect my borders than you do. Though they are similar tactically, the reality is that you in Belgium means that you can cut my support from Picardy if there's war with Ben.\r\n11 FRANCE -> GERMANY: Are you at work typing all this? lol.\r\n12 GERMANY -> FRANCE: PS. I see that you withdrew your Draw vote. I expect you are tryin to come up with a masterful plan to ally with Brydon to overthrow the rightful heirs to the world. It would indeed be a cool turn of events if you could pull that off, and perhaps you need to show that you are trying to take Belgium to get him on board, but I am guarding against you.\r\n13 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Yes, I am at work.... catching up on [1452379] emails... Zzzz\r\n14 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I withdrew it because I had it in when I thought I was going to die. Then, I'd take ANY draw.\n\nRight now, I'm aiming for the 4-way draw. I don't want the game to go to a draw RIGHT NOW, so I've temporarily withdrawn my draw vote.\r\n15 FRANCE -> GERMANY: haha. Poor you.\r\n16 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Going to go now. Just to be clear - if you move to Bel, I will take it as a declaration of ear.\r\n17 GERMANY -> FRANCE: Haha. War. Not a declaration of ear. Lol\r\n18 FRANCE -> GERMANY: Here is the deal I want to make with you: I will not attack Ben. I do not plan to take ANY Scs from him, but I'll also not sit back while he stabs me. I'm going to fight him if it comes to it.\n\nYou've been an honest player, and I'd dare to call you an ally during the last few turns. You even sought to spare me when I was trying to surrender, which is a play that doesn't often happen early on. You're generous, and understanding of the long-term consequences of your actions in this game.\n\nIf Ben attacks, I therefore ask that you honour your agreement and remain neutral. Attack Tyrus for control of the south if you must, but stay neutral in the north and let Ben and I duke it out.\r\n",

It does depend on how much you feel like you can trust Russia after all!\n\nBut if you don't mind just moving Ionian Sea to Naples, I will bounce with Rome? :)\n\nRussia's supporting me to Vienna. I'm not sure if I should move Adriatic to Trieste. Feels like a waste, but with the Albanian fleet still kicking... I feel like they're more likely to go to Greece, but still...\r\n1 TURKEY -> ITALY: What if you let me into Nap this turn so you can bring Adr back into ION? Then in Fall I can take Nap to ION or Apu.\r\n2 TURKEY -> ITALY: I'm going to support myself into Gre\r\n3 ITALY -> TURKEY: So I'm going Pie -> Tyrolia to try and bounce Germany.\nTrieste's getting a lift to Vienna, so I may have to send Adriatic into Trieste.\n\nThe intent is to try and stop France from expanding. I was thinking that if we bounce this yr and basically keep France outta Naples this year, I'll maybe be able to build a fleet there? So uhm, the concern for me is that if you go Naples this year around, I can't really claim it back bc I only have one fleet unit (Romania).\r\n4 ITALY -> TURKEY: But then, I'm kinda not playing to win atm. So if you really want Naples, I can give it? Just lemme know\r\n5 TURKEY -> ITALY: France says he's supporting me into Nap, so if I move there, I'll get in.\r\n6 TURKEY -> ITALY: But I'm with you in wanting to keep France from expanding too much. He just has so many damn fleets\r\n7 ITALY -> TURKEY: Hmm, do you want me to support ou into Tyrr Sea instead then?\r\n8 ITALY -> TURKEY: Or lemme know what alternatives you're considering?\r\n9 ITALY -> TURKEY: &you\r\n10 ITALY -> TURKEY: I can just go Adriatic to Ionian to fill temporarily too because I am infused about losses elsewhere.\r\n11 ITALY -> TURKEY: &[1355675]\r\n12 ITALY -> TURKEY: I'm trying to play a bit of a guessing game so that I can generate 1 more unit next turn & a fleet in Naples, so that we can drive France back.\r\n13 ITALY -> TURKEY: However, obviously, I'm open to whatever else. My goal is just to keep France back.\r\n14 TURKEY -> ITALY: Where is your new build coming from?\r\n15 ITALY -> TURKEY: New one potentially coming from Russia's support into Vienna and destruction of Tunis; I'm unsure if France will and hoped that he might have told you?\r\n16 ITALY -> TURKEY: Okay, hmm, I'm thinking if you go to Naples, I'll let Russia know to just take Vienna (since I can't really back up Trieste if Adriatic is moving to Ionian). That will leave me two units down, so I can disband Trieste.\n\nYou're going to take Greece and Naples - 2 builds next turn. Then a 3rd in the turn after, which might be enough?\r\n17 TURKEY -> ITALY: Yes, I expect Tun to get taken out this turn.\r\n18 TURKEY -> ITALY: I don't need to take Nap, just floating it as an option to keep it out of French hands and mobilize that fleet left behind in ADR.\r\n19 ITALY -> TURKEY: I'm just not sure what would be the best possible outcome at this stage.\n\nB/c if I do support you into Tyrr this turn, we will have stalled France a little bit. But he will have 3 fleets Gol and Western Med and Tunis. But during that time, you can move Con into Aegean (I'm guessing that is where it's going?) I can see about grabbing Vienna.\n\nNext turn, France will have to support move you out of Tyrr and probably use Naf to get into Ionian to stop you from retreating there - unless, instead of that, you're using Smyrna to support move back to Ionian. Another wasted turn for France.\n\nHowever, a lot of this hinges on me actually &obtaining& Vienna.\r\n20 TURKEY -> ITALY: Right. What are the odds Russia doesn't just try to take it for themselves. I've reached out to them and I'm trying to suss out what they plan to do there. I'll keep you posted\r\n21 ITALY -> TURKEY: Hmm, I'm not sure. I said the same to Russia in that - I don't mind if they don't want to give it to me, just give me a heads up, but they've said they'd like to so that I can make up for the loss of a native centre.\r\n22 ITALY -> TURKEY: If I don't get it, though, I can leave Trieste where it is, move to Apulia whilst you grab up Tyrr. That way, the stall would work for us to position Adriatic in Naples/fleet in Rome and your fleet in Ionian/Aegean.\n\nThen, my problem is a matter of dealing with France/Germany, since Germany wants to wait instead of turning on France, even though France would really only just get stronger :/\r\n23 TURKEY -> ITALY: Yeah Germany has been real annoying. What he's waiting for I don't know.\r\n24 ITALY -> TURKEY: Germany is slowly killing my &soul&\r\n25 ITALY -> TURKEY: He wants Vienna so that he can do it or whatever. I told him he can LITERALLY take Belgium in if he moves to Burgundy this turn, but now he's ignoring me again, which means he w o n ' t.\r\n26 TURKEY -> ITALY: Yeah he's giving the game to France and I have no idea why\r\n27 ITALY -> TURKEY: This is the last msg he sent me:\nYes, but Russia/Turkey seem to very tight and Russia is going west. And we all know how an EFG alliance usually is ending. Austria will go first, then you, then I will probably get squeezed out and the game will end with a 4 way draw. Or what do you think?\r\n28 ITALY -> TURKEY: I think France is playing to win, and I told him as much straight up.\r\n29 ITALY -> TURKEY: Mmkay, he's responded and told me that the juggernaut is a bigger threat.\r\n30 ITALY -> TURKEY: This is what Germany said:\n\"I will go ti Tyrolia. I might need to go East with Munich. At my east side the juggernaut is gaming strenght and is approaching my borders. I consider them to be as big a threat as EF.\"\n\nI will bounce him in Tyrolia from Piedmont since I can't stop France from getting into Marseilles anyway. But that's certainly irksome.\r\n31 ITALY -> TURKEY: Lemme know what to do with Rome's fleet as soon as you know :)\r\n32 TURKEY -> ITALY: Okay: Russia is going to support you into Vie\r\n33 ITALY -> TURKEY: All right, that sounds good. What do you want to do with your fleet?\r\n34 TURKEY -> ITALY: If you support my into Tyr, that fleet can retreat to Nap and be even more annoying because when we kick it out in the fall you won't be able to build there.\n\nI really wish ADR didn't have to cover Tri because we could use that fleet power\r\n35 ITALY -> TURKEY: Fuck, yeah. I forgot about that... Same with me. Unless... would you wanna move Serbia to Trieste?\r\n36 TURKEY -> ITALY: What if we pop that fleet in Alb in the Spring, then you go to Vie in the Fall?\n\nADR goes to Apu, ION supports Tun.\r\n37 ITALY -> TURKEY: Spring as in this turn, yes?\n\nMmm, yeah! Russia wants me to go in the Fall (next turn) so he can reposition to fend off possible Germany attack. He suggested support moving Trieste into Tyrolia in case Germany moves there. But I don't want to leave Trieste open unless I know you're there to fill it/bounce Albania.\r\n38 ITALY -> TURKEY: ADR => APU coming right up :)\r\n39 ITALY -> TURKEY: Thank you so much for taking me over France, though :)\r\n40 TURKEY -> ITALY: Are you moving to Tyr?\r\n41 ITALY -> TURKEY: I think Ionian supporting Tunis is a smart move. Prevents more France builds for the next turn, even if I have a useless army stationed there.\r\n42 ITALY -> TURKEY: I think I should move to Tyr with Trieste because there's a possibility Germany is being honest with me, and I need to prevent that G-F attack.\r\n43 TURKEY -> ITALY: I thought Pie was going to Tyr. If Tri moves and I pop Alb, it can retreat to Tri\r\n44 ITALY -> TURKEY: Got it.\nMy moves this turn:\nPie move to Tyr.\nTrieste support move Pie to Tyr.\nRome hold.\nAdr move to Apulia.\r\n45 ITALY -> TURKEY: France is invested in supporting you to Naples, yes?\r\n46 TURKEY -> ITALY: Great.\r\n47 TURKEY -> ITALY: In order to kick that fleet out of Tyr, we need four fleets on it in Tus, Rom, Nap and Ion. If France takes Tun in the Fall, he will build another fleet in Mar and we will have trouble breaking through.\n\nSo, let's set ourselves up to have those fleets where we need them before France's fourth fleet arrives. In the Fall, Rom will go to Tus, Apu will go to Nap, and ION will stay put. You'll build a new fleet in Rom and we'll be positioned to knock out Tyr next spring.\r\n48 TURKEY -> ITALY: Tri needs to support Ser-alb\r\n49 ITALY -> TURKEY: Next turn:\n- France will Marseilles. They shall advance to Pied, which I'll bounce from my nice little place in Tyrolia so that they cannot build in Mars. Even if Germany bumps me out, I'll duck back to Venice.\n- Trieste will advance, with Russia's support into Vienna.\n- The issue here is, I am unsure how to play it so that Adriatic doesn't occupy Naples for my fleet build...\r\n50 ITALY -> TURKEY: Ah, you answered my question! Thank you.\r\n51 ITALY -> TURKEY: No worries. I'll change Tri to support Ser-alb right now.\r\n52 TURKEY -> ITALY: Yes, a new fleet in Rom is the same as one in Nap for our purposes\r\n53 TURKEY -> ITALY: Wait, Alb can retreat to ADR\r\n54 ITALY -> TURKEY: Ahh, yeah, okay. That would be a problem if he does that to support F somehow or tries to creep into Venice when I'm busy bouncing Pie/Trieste is moving to Vie.\nDo you wanna focus on grabbing up Greece for now?\r\n55 ITALY -> TURKEY: I will stay in Trieste this turn and hope that Austria doesn't try for Adriatic.\r\n56 TURKEY -> ITALY: No, I think we should stick with the plan. If ADR supports Ser-apu this turn, we lose a little tempo but we can pop that fleet for once and for all.\r\n57 ITALY -> TURKEY: Okay, we can stick to the plan!\nIn the next turn, however, there might come a tiny problem of me having to fend off Albania fleet from Venice with either: Apulia fleet, Trieste army or Pied/Tyrolia army.\r\n58 ITALY -> TURKEY: Ah shit, wait, I will also be moving Trieste to Vien so like, I'd have to try and defend Venice &and& Trieste's empty lots.\r\n59 TURKEY -> ITALY: The Alb fleet will disappear if you support Ser-alb from ADR\r\n60 TURKEY -> ITALY: So you won't have to worry about covering Ven\r\n61 ITALY -> TURKEY: Right, got it. Sorry - I didn't read the ADR part, I think. That sounds good. Minimise any future issues. We'll be a little bit behind, but it should hopefully be okay.\r\n62 ITALY -> TURKEY: Thank you for brainstorming with me & let's try and check in again once the moves are updated!\r\n63 ITALY -> TURKEY: To reiterate:\nTrieste support move to Tyrolia from Pied.\nTunis hold.\nAdriatic support move to Alb from Serbia.\nPiedmont move to Tyrolia.\nRome hold.\r\n64 TURKEY -> ITALY: Rom might as well tap TYR\r\n65 TURKEY -> ITALY: But otherwise great\r\n66 ITALY -> TURKEY: Rome tap Tyrolia?\r\n67 ITALY -> TURKEY: NVM tyrolia, got it.\r\n68 ITALY -> TURKEY: &tyrrhenian sea\r\n69 TURKEY -> ITALY: Sorry, TYH\r\n",

So to devils advocate maybe my potential \"rally\" with Ger is a smoke screen. My fleet in north st Peters is to your advantage to prevent an army unit in Moscow. You want Ger & I to hold while you gain a surer foot in Rome & Aus. As you have stayed in the black sea (I believe you could have moved in to Sevastopol before after I missed my turn you will turn on Italy via the Ionian sea. Italy may have rumbled your game as he did not take Serbia & can still support his own fleet in the ionian sea? Is that a good evaluation of the Turkish strat?\r\n1 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I don't expect a straight answer ... (of course lol)\r\n2 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: Lol, if I wanted to win, I wouldn't have encouraged you to build a fleet in Sevas (which is only useful against me) and I would have wanted you to fight Germany. I just want you to get the hang of the game, and you'll pick it up better being allied with Germany.\r\n3 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: Well allowing the build @ sevas is part of the elaborate conspiracy. Also I have observed you may have had a hand in 9/11 while working for the CIA & possible in league with the French.\r\n4 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: Oh for sure. But now I have to kill you....\r\n5 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: lol. Jokes aside though that would not be too difficult, I cannot support my army in Budapest from Rum so I think I'll abandon it,move to Galicia. Are you going to offer Italy Serbia again? If he's not taking it maybe you should move there from Bulgaria. I could support but I'd also move to the Ukraine from Warsaw. the [1010521] Juggernaut is not to be left to chance.\r\n6 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: Btw in your other game with [787007], Russia went all the way into Munich & left his underside open & then asked you not to move to Sevastopol.. That was taking you for granted was it not an a very poor strat? he was asking for it lol\r\n7 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I've been toying also @ attempting to move into Trieste Just to stick it to Aus lol. I could move down from Warsaw but might lose Budapest?\r\n8 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: 2 hrs ? if I don't hear from you I will do what I think best. :D [1481493] teeth\r\n9 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: Italy is going into serbia, yeah.\n\nI'd probably move Budapest to trieste, as it means if he doesn't cover it, you keep digging into Austria, and if he does cover it, it means serbia can't retreat there (serbia will be dislodged this turn). If Austria doesn't take budapest, he is in real trouble.\n\nI'd move warsaw to silesia and livonia to Prussia if you are worried about germany. If you aren't, then I'd move warsaw to galicia and Livonia to warsaw.\n\nIf you are talking to Germany though, he ought to give you advice; if you don't like germany too much you might want to support norway lol.\r\n10 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: Yeah Ger advised against supporting Norway, a threat etc. But he otherwise wants to return to our initial dmz he will get Norway but the French are quite aggressive into the UK I don't see what options he has there unless he turns on France... or on me. Its stretch into Trieste/bounce & if I take it he could possibly push me out.\r\n11 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: If he re takes Buda I will have no retreat from Trieste. Its a bit tenuous.\r\n12 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I've had a hap hazard 1st go at any rate, I may as well attempt to stick it to Aus I coud play safer but that is not conducive to my learning curve :)\r\n13 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: Btw if I bounce in Trieste & Aus moves into Budapest is that the conditions of a unit being destroyed with no retreat etc?\r\n",

In return, I will move rum-sev and support bul-rum.\r\n1 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: I would like to play the moves you have suggested, but I'm afraid they won't work. Russia will most likely play Gal-bud, Sev S Ukr-rum. If we play your moves, you will take Sev, but I won't take Rum and moreover Sev will retreat to Armenia and I will have to defend Ankara next year. Any suggestion how to resolve this issue?\n\nOtherwise I agree and I will move to the Ionian Sea.\r\n2 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: Do you see a better way to take sev? Even if you don't take rum, you get a build. I don't think Russia will retreat to arm, as that leaves mos wide open -- he is more likely to disband the fleet and build an army in mos. Even if he does, you plop an army in ank and his fleet gets destroyed in the spring. Also, if you don't take rum this turn, I will support you there again in the spring, and you will be able to take it then.\r\n3 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: Could we wait a year? After I build a new army, I would feel much safer and would be happy to attack Russia with you.\r\n4 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: If we wait a year, the Russians will drop an army in mos and no progress will be possible. You don't have to worry about me stabbing you -- there's no way for me to do so! And without sev, Russia is not able to stab you either.\r\n5 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: I will be on until about 40 before the deadline.\r\n6 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: 40 minutes, that is. I do need to know what you decide so I can plan accordingly. I think the position of the units means that if we don't take sev now, we will never take it. You will either get a build now and then a two builds next year or two builds now and one build next year (assuming you take tun next year).\r\n7 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: FYI, Russia is asking me to support Galicia to Rumania. That's what I was afraid of -- there is no way how could I take Rumania and honestly, I wouldn't like to stab Russia just to help you grow two times faster than I.\r\n8 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: What do you want to do then? If we don't take sev now, Russia can defend it indefinitely. And even with sev, rum, and rom, I'd only get one build, as I only have one home center open. And that's assuming I can keep both ven and tri!\r\n9 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: Even if you don't help me take sev, Russia will probably take even a lack of support into rum as a stab . . . at some point, you're going to have to choose to side with me or with Russia. If you choose Russia, this game almost certainly ends in a Russian win, as he's kicking butt in the north, and I will collapse faster than a pricked balloon.\r\n10 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: Come back! I only have 50 more minutes to make sure our moves are coordinated!\r\n11 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: I've already told Russia I won't support him to Rumania. I don't worry he could win the game. 7-centre Russia in 1906 is not dangerous at all. I think we can wait for a while and Bulgaria can simply hold or support Greece. I'm sorry, my decision would be much easier if you didn't lie me twice (or was it three times?).\r\n12 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: Alright, I will expect you to hold, making no supports of my units nor of Russia's units. Thanks for getting back to me.\r\n13 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: Nor attacks either! And it would help if you went to ion so you could take tun next year.\r\n14 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: Wait a minute . . . if Russia has gal-rum, ukr s gal-rum, sev s ukr-rum, and we support rum-sev and bul-rum, they should both succeed. You'd have two supports into rum, and sev s gal-rum is cut because the fleet is dislodged.\r\n15 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: I've changed to hold orders for now . . . let me know if you agree with that analysis.\r\n16 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: Well, I've already refused Russia's request and he may change his plan.\r\n17 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: You would get rum unless Russia orders sev-rum with gal and ukr supporting, in which case I wouldn't get sev either. Basically, there is no case where I get sev and you don't get rum.\r\n18 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: OK, let's do that. Please support Bulgaria to Rumania by both Budapest and Serbia. I'll support Rumania to Sevastopol. If it is a trap, I'll rather give all my centres to Russia.\r\n19 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: Done. Likewise, if you're trapping me, I will give all my centers to Russia as well. Now we have a mutual death pact =)\r\n20 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: Good luck.\r\n21 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: Maybe Russia will NMR . . . that might be asking too much though!\r\n22 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: You too. See you after the deadline. Thanks for being patient with me.\r\n23 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: Thank you too.\r\n",

I'd be happy to ensure you benefit from this, e.g. by supporting you to Hol, giving Yor back, etc.\n\nLooking forward, England!\n\nPS: I am curious whether Germany has made a proposal to you. He proposed to me to let him have two builds so he can attack Russia next year... Right. But if I look at the map, I don't see any possiblity where he could make you a proposal that is even remotely comparable to the one I offer you. So I do hope we can make this work.\r\n1 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: Hi!\nI'm here, just I couldn't see your [855225] while the game was paused. And now I'm on a ski holiday, so I'm afraid I can answer slowly.\r\n2 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I'm happy you think you should choose me for ally, but it is a little bit late. :) I don't beleive I will make a come back, so I'm trying to achive nobody could make solo here. I don't have too much opportunity but I use what I have. I felt Germany is the weakest from the first 3 players so I offered Edi to him.\nAs I see he used my help wisely so he won't be the weakest, so this turn I can help you. :)\r\n3 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I don't have too much time to analyze, but Jugg is over as I see, as Turkey stabs Russia. With a weak Russia Germany could get even stronger. I'm curious what will happen.\r\n4 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: Strong decision making! Solo won't happen this game I think, but you are right best to be cautious. Your other objective can be to be in as part of the draw right? Germany offered me Lon if he could keep Bel. But why stab me first to then negotiate is my idea.\n\nWhich is why I'd like to turn the offer around, in the way I proposed to you. Are you on board with the moves I suggested?\r\n5 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: Yes, solo is very difficult to achive, but there could be weak players or players with other goals. I don't know, I'm afraid Germany could fell down quickly, I hope just he won't be stupid to help any other solo.\nBut know I think he has still a worse position if he has more territory. I would happy to give Lon to you, and I hope you will help Germany wisely after Russia stabs him.\r\n6 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: Let's start with the beginning and get you back into Edi. I wonder what you and Germany communicated in the meantime as I am sure you did. I don't trust Germany but I do trust you.\r\n7 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: Lon is fine but not necessary. And I will definitely help Germany when Russia stabs him.\r\n8 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I don't have time to communicate, but I'm not a player now who counts. You can be sure I won't help him now against you.\r\n9 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: Agree. I support you into Edi and hope Lon will cut support in Nth. See you in Winter!\r\n",

It looks unlikely that France will survive England's attack, however....I've been toying with the idea of not attack Russia. With the forces that he has know he really can only threaten Scandanavia. A Russian-english War could be enough for France to beat off the English attack. On the other hand part of me says just take Russia out when I have the chance. What do you think? ~N~ ~N~ Hmmm, if you're moving Rumania I'll retreat Seva to Arm. Although I do feel uncomfortable having the Army in Moscow unsupported.\r\n5 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: I think I'll move to Tunis now. I will move Aegean sea to the Ionian. I may (if I'm luckily) be able to take Naples the Next turn\r\n6 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: regarding the border, i will leave ukr so only have a single unit in warsaw. ~N~ i know what you mean about russia, but if he plans on attacking england i think he will, regardless if we stop attacking jhim or not. he has given up on berlin , st petes will be difficult to get, needs us taking livonia first, a 2 year project if russia moves right\r\n7 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: i will leave rum and ukra if sevas pulls abck to armenia. ~N~ so that extends our border DMZ s to ukr,sevas,rumania.bulgaria and serbia, ~N~ greece with a fleet is of course ok.\r\n8 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: im helping england into ruhr this turn, yea i troo prefer france but the best way for me to secure my german properties is to have fleet heavy england in kiel and get his army down into france.\r\n9 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: too\r\n10 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: i really only have berlin, maybe rome? as future targets in this game. would prefer if the 3 of us had equal sc at the end but it looks like you and I might but england will get more, maybe if we take italy quickly we can have you take spain and i can mars, but we need to give advice to france to stay alive a bit longer\r\n11 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: or maybe i can get st petes and in return you have rome? or the other way around, both ok with me\r\n12 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: Rome is yours if you want it. I have a gut feeling Italy is also abandoning Naples and going on an all out attack on you, so I might end up with Naples this year also. ~N~ ~N~ I'm not going to commit to either France of England yet. If France is still viable in a few years I'll help him with my fleets. If England looks dominant I'll be more than happy to work with him\r\n13 AUSTRIA -> TURKEY: ok. i will go with your choice too, that way we can swing it to the partner we want.\r\n",

You could also attack Silesia with support, I support Munich to hold. Then he can't walk up the line.

I told Germany to not attack Holland, and just before last season went through Germany sent me a short message about how he'd take Holland and why that was good for the two of us, which is clearly bullshit and a stab of me by Germany. Germany stabbed me years ago and this is another stab of me by Germany, so I can't really do anything with Germany right now, Germany needs to show some actions that demonstrate his willingness to stop a Russian solo before I will work with Germany, so until that time, kudos to Russia on a win well earned.\r\n6 AUSTRIA -> ENGLAND: The logical thing would be to trade den for hol -- one of you gets one, and the other gets the other?\r\n7 ENGLAND -> AUSTRIA: That was the deal, I keep Holland, Germany gets Den.

I'm not salty, I'm not mad. it's a game with literally no real stakes.\n\nIt just became clear you had nothing to contribute that I needed to listen to. There is 0 point in you being able to message me or me being able to message you.\r\n2 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: well, if you wanted to, we could work together and actually block Ionian Sea, and you could hold onto Tunis, and we could stop the Turkish advance, or you could commit further suicide, I suppose, if you want.\r\n3 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: No thanks. I have no interest in working with, or even really talking to you. You're selfish and manipulative as an 'ally' and an incredibly poor sport as an enemy. You're basically not worth my time.\r\n4 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: okay, then prepare to die I guess, good game.\r\n5 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: Likewise! :D\r\n6 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: ah, it's quite certain that you will die, but perhaps I might not, i will just become \"new Italy\" and ally with France to stop the juggernaut, which is what you should have done with me, oh well.\r\n7 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: I would have loved to. If you ever gave me a chance to operate as your ally.\n\nIn the future, maybe don't do any \"blue water Lepantos\" as they are a great way to ensure Italy will never again trust, like, or work with you.\r\n8 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: okay, well, all you had to do is dislodge me from Ionian, and I would have gone to East med, but no.... you wanted to do a \"fake attack\" on France, then a shift to attack Austria, then a suicide move. very erratic play. that why no one wants to ally with you. I have people that actually want to ally with me.\r\n9 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: No no. You put a gun to my head and tried to force my moves. You would have made me be your puppet with where I got to convoy my armies and who could have taken what Turkish centers. I never wanted you in the Ionian.\n\nYou consistently showed 0 regard for my well-being or interests and only for your own.\n\nThat's why the blue water move was bad.\r\n10 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: very bad, for you, not so much for me.\r\n11 ITALY -> AUSTRIA: once again you prove to be literally incapable of seeing any one's perspective other than your own. Which is again why you are such a terrible Ally. your inability to see that my interests were important to us having any sort of a partnership is why we never had one. this is also why I decided to mute you. Because you have nothing useful or helpful to contribute to anyone other than yourself. I don't know if this is just how you play diplomacy or if you are a human being devoid of empathy or understanding of other people I genuinely hope that it's only the former. I'm going to stop replying to you because it seems neither of us have anything useful to contribute to the other. Hopefully you don't keep making snide remarks and I don't have to meet you once again. Good luck with the rest of the game and the rest of the tournament.\r\n12 AUSTRIA -> ITALY: I love SNIDE remarks, and sticking it to crappy players like you... enjoy losing my loser Italian player.\r\n",

The idea was to destroy Holland, and move Burgudny to Paris, supported by Picardy and Brest.\n/sigh\nOh well, it was your loss this time.\n\nTo remedy this, I will be convoying to Belgium this. In autumn, you'll support me in with Picardy and Munich, while I use Ruhr. That way, we get Burgundy back, so we'll be back where we should've been...\r\n1 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Take the mid Atlantic and convoy to somewhere on Iberia, I'm not putting off taking Belgium any longer. Though in hindsight, I could've moved Burgundy>Belgium, but I'll put that up to stupidity on my part.\nNext turn: Kiel to Munich, supported by Ruhr, Picardy and Brest to Paris (Just in case we get lucky).\nThen next turn, Ruhr to Burgundy, so we can take Paris.\r\n2 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: /sigh\nI'm not trying like instate a totalitarian dictatorship in this alliance. My ranking isn't this high for nothing...I know what I'm doing. Every time you've gone against what I've told you, the plan resulted in disaster, and you know that. If you begin to start listening to me, we might actually be able to end this game in a 17-17 draw like I originally planned. You see, I'm trying to balance out my wins, defeats, and draws at 6. So far the former are at 6, and draws are at 4. I am about to draw my other game. So all I need to do is to draw this game to achieve my goal.\nSo, if you could do both of a favor, could please stop putting SC obtainment as your primary goal? We are going for logic, and most effective plan here. France shouldn't take this long to defeat... So, let me explain you my logics so you know I'm not randomly throwing around crap to get me Sc's. This is the plan, as I see it. Picardy and Brest support hold each other, allowing Irish Sea to get to MAO safely. Getting a fleet to MAO gurantees a succesful move from Belgium to Burgundy, still allowing you Belgium. So, end result is, you still get Belgium by the build cycle, and we're in a stronger position, etc.. If you need me to re-explain any of this, I'd be happy to. But, do you see where my exsasperation lies? We are allies, I am doing stuff on the agenda of both of us, whereas you are looking at yourself. If we are to be strong allies, we need to be communicating well, and in complete understanding of each others logics. At this point, your moves seem very illogical to me... Sorry to be so forceful in this message, but I've been trying to get this point across to you in the past messages, and I don't think I'm explaining myself clear enough for you to understand.\r\n3 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Well look at it from my point of view, I have an eastern border that is 100% undefended. If Russia, Austria OR Italy decide to attack me, there's little I can do (And I don't want to think about what would happen if 2 of them joined forces.)\nNow, join that with the fact that you seem to be doing all that is possible to hold Sc's from me (No point dancing around that topic, that's just how it seems), and I get more than a bit worried.\n\nNow, I do see logic in your plan, so I'll go with it. To clarify the plan on my end: Holland holds, Picardy supports Brest, Kiel moves to Munich with support from Ruhr.\n\nHowever, I do have a suggestion. If you keep the army in London this turn (Not an attempt to keep it out of Belgium, just bear with me!) and move Ruhr to Burgundy after we take Munich, that means we have an army in Burgundy at the same time, /and/ we have an army in London which can be convoyed to France's rear. And that means we wont have an army sitting in Ruhr doing a whole lot of nothing.\r\n4 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: And I do apologise for frustrating you, that's never been my intention!\r\n5 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: That wouldn't work it; there wouldn't be enough units to get into Burgundy. Taking Belgium in the Spring of Fall will still result in the same outcome; you'll get a build. Plus, you're going to need that build anyways, so I need to make sure you get it. Munich will be retreating to Berlin, so to completely get the French out of your territory. you'll have to be building in either Kiel or Brest. Basically, you're going to get Belgium anyways, its just the matter when; in spring, or fall. Secondally, Picardy support holds Brest, and Brest supports Picardy; we're not going to go for Paris this turn.\r\n6 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I'm not too worried at this point as to whether I got Belgium in Spring or Autumn, I just thought it'd be better than just having your army sitting in Ruhr without doing anything. If we attack Gascony and Paris (No chance of taking them, but just to make sure they don't support) then you could move into Burgundy with support from Munich.\nAs you say, it's all about getting the most units possible in France.\r\n7 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Well, Ruhr is needed to gurantee Belgium to Burgundy; there's not enough supports to make it into Burgundy as it stands. Does that make sense? Also, the probability of convoying units into Iberia isn't very high, the outcome could very well end up having that army still in London, back where we started. If London goes through Belgium, that puts an extra unit in the French territory, no matter what. I think we've been taking too many gambles; it'd be best to stick with what'll work for sure, so we can finish up France ASAP, and pursue other people like Austria and Russia...\r\n8 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Well, if we attack Paris and Gascony, there will only be the unit in Burgundy to defend it, so we can take it with Ruhr/Munich. Belgium wont be threatened at all, as it'll be behind the front lines. So we'll have 3 units directly able to attack France (As we would with the other plan) /and/ we have a unit that can actually do something against France instead of sitting in the rear.\r\n9 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Though if we do that, I wont be able to take Berlin back.\nI guess your plan wins!\r\n10 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: Okay, confirmed, dont forget to support hold Brest from Picardy.\r\n11 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: And don't forget to support attack Munich from Kiel ;)\r\n",
