I'm not really sure where the game is headed to be honest, this hasn't been my best round but life has conspired to out it on the back burner a bit, and so combined with not having many people besides you talking a lot, I'll admit I've been giving it less focus than I'd like. I don't think that either of us will do well if we commit to fighting, though, so I'm hoping to see you head west to take advantage of England and Germany's squabble before they make peace. Germany won't be able to make meaningful progress on his own, so you should be able to cut a sweetheart deal for your fleets against England with him I'd think. Meanwhile, a concrete signal of you actually backing off and sending units against another power would enable me to do the same and turn north. I'd expect we'd be able to eventually finish off one or the other of Germany and England and probably bog down at a 3wd after that, unless you want to try and push for a 2wd which I'd be ok with trying since as I said you're the only one really talking and I've enjoyed the communication. If the tournament is going well for you, or you want to optimize our scoring, I think I'd even be ok with us getting to the end and flipping a coin or whoever has the most points from other rounds or something, and giving that person the solo.\n\nThat was a long message, sorry more rambling than I'd intended.

As you can see I have stabbed Austria, seeing as he wasn't helping me much anyway! ~N~ Obviously as things stand you are missing bits of your homeland to both me and to Austria. I just want you to know that I would like to offer again (genuinely this time) the hand of friendship. You would make a much more practical ally for me because you will soon be able to strike against the main threat in this game, France. I know me and France are on the same number of supply centres, but at the moment he has Italy as an ally and only tiny fragments of Germany and England resisting him - I currently have no allies and Russia, Austria and Italy all out to get me! ~N~ So I'm hoping I can do a deal with you to balance things up again. ~N~ So my proposal is: this turn, Moscow support Sev > Ukr, and next turn my Ukr will support Liv > War, and Moscow can move into Sev. Austria won't expect us to ally (particularly if you pretend to ally with him!), and by the next build you will have all your home Sc's back. ~N~ Basically I need your help (Italy is my back-up plan but he's allied with France), otherwise I'm out of this game.

I was thinking maybe that I have a unit in SER and you have one in SEV and we bounce in RUM continuously. You place your fleet in ANK and I keep a fleet in GRE, both of which do not move.

Also, since I have the army in Prussia, I can more readily support myself south while you use your additional build to get another fleet with which to fight France. Actually, it's fairly simple and I'm confident it will work. If I lose Belgium it'll be because France has compromised Brest and MAO, and in the long run that will be more disastrous for him.

I understand your concerns with my units in the north. I've been trying to figure out how we can keep ourselves safe without inflating the units. Would the following work: ~N~ ~N~ St. Pete back to Moscow, Finland to St. Pete, Gulf of Bothnia holds. ~N~ ~N~ Sweden holds, Norway holds. Kiel takes Berlin (or perhaps we work it out so you get Berlin), I move the rest of my fleets back. We can then bounce in Finland if we feel the need. ~N~ ~N~ The problem I see is that if you remained allied with Austria, that is a bigger problem for me that my alliance with France is for you. France doesn't really factor in it for you, since you by association have Italy on your side with no southern threat. If you build Warsaw, you can move that back to Moscow easily, or to Purssia, while Austria moves to Boh. It's a tough position for me. ~N~ ~N~ Of course, Austria could still be fake stabbing, like he pretended he would years ago. Who am I to tell? ~N~ ~N~ Thoughts?\r"

I think it very likely you pick up STP though if you take Mos-liv and Sev-mos.

I'm sure you understand. :) I do think we've both got plenty of growth potential right now and in my experience, lack of growth potential should be the primary reason for a stab unless it's going to be a knockout blow. With me picking up Trieste back, there is a chance you could pick up Rumania AND Bulgaria off me, but going down one and having me turning around vs. you likely picking up STP and definitely getting Ionian seems like a bad gamble.

The position in which you would like to reduce me is perfectly uninteresting and it is far too early in the game for me to feel like it's my only avenue. I think it fair to say that you stand a much better chance of peace in the north with a semi-content England than with a fully disillusioned one.\n\nLondon is safe. I've disbanded in Yor for that very reason. I also disbanded there to show an open face on my island and make sure you'd get the signal that, though I moved somewhat differently than what you had ordered, I'm not trying to show strength or threaten your positions. Hells, you can convoy there if you'd like now!\n\nNorway gives me a little shot at raising myself to 4 units. It cannot threaten Sweden nor Den without putting me quite out of position. And if you don't tell me what you do, I'll be assuming you to move exactly as you said, i.e. against me. Meanwhile, if you move Den to Swe (for security), Swe to Fin, Kiel to Bal (you can even move it to Hel if you want, but it's not as effective I think), you can count on my full support in the fall to move to St-p. You'll then have a shot at Norway if you really want one.\n\nIf I can do that, and I have a fleet in the channel, I can convoy my built army in France and slowly secure the west, blocking Italy's progress if he tries for any. Get me up to 5 units, I blockade MAO.\n\nAlso, Edi is absolutely ready to be convoyed straight to France in the Spring if we want to. It will leave my island wide open to your attacks (huge guarantee) and it could help take Brest (Pic supports, Bur hits Paris) to secure you Paris in the Fall.\n\nI think my disbands leave you with more options than what you had in mind. I also think they do not yell my continued collaboration with you as your suggestions would have, giving me a slight chance to hear what will happen in Russia, France, Italy and... Austria.\r"

I'm willing to build fleets only in Liverpool if I can count on your help for Brest and Spain. I will set up a stalemate line there and you'll be able to roam freely in the east.\n\nBut if I can't have that, if I can't have that little, what's the point, right? I love this game because it there's always a way to \"play\" it, even when you're down to almost nothing. But your attitude towards me after my refusal to DMZ the NTH has been making it impossible for me to play: your orders are strict and our communications one-way. My \"threat\" on the global channel was actually the expression of my desire to put an end to a cycle of phases where I would have no chance to enjoy the game.\n\nSo just to be clear: I'm not asking you to give me anything that would endanger you, but I am asking, in return for that convoy to Brest, that you consider making our collaboration a touch more dynamic and involving for all. As you can see, this is not exactly a demand (see first paragraph!) but a plea for your consideration.

I think the Italian was nervous the F/G was hiding their alliance and that France would slip into North Africa and West Med last season, though the move on Pie was pretty aggressive. I can't really figure out where the Italian's brain is it, which started when he took Tyrolia early on, but I didn't really want to send Budapest at him without saying something first, so I ended up telling him that since he was in Ven I was nervous and would be going to Trieste, he ended up bouncing me out, obviously. Anyway, I guess he trusts me enough to leave Smy on its own so that's something.\n\nAnyway, what do you want Sil to do now? Mun and Pru may bounce in Berlin, so I could support Prussia to Berlin? How do you want to handle Turkey, just sit and hold and wait for him to lose a unit or try to grab Con too? I'm typically a pretty patient guy, so sitting and holding works great for me, but if you want to get more aggressive this season so you can focus on the north, I'm sure we could come up with something. Like, if you wanted to try to get a build we could get risky and have Aeg and Smy support Bul to Con while Greece supports Rum to Bul and Sev hits Black Sea, since I can't imagine Black Sea attacking Rum (it would be open, Bud plans to attack Trieste again). I'm a go with the flow kind of guy, so it's totally your call, especially since the risk will be yours.\n\nThat's all I got!

I don't really see what can be done with the current units, looks like the most reasonable thing to do is St.p-liv with support from WAR and Bar-st.p.? This way at least there's a wall from SIL to St.p.\n\nPlus, if I do get a get a build in the South I will be able to place in MOS, or if he bounced me, even in St.p.

Every time you've gone against what I've told you, the plan resulted in disaster, and you know that. If you begin to start listening to me, we might actually be able to end this game in a 17-17 draw like I originally planned. You see, I'm trying to balance out my wins, defeats, and draws at 6. So far the former are at 6, and draws are at 4. I am about to draw my other game. So all I need to do is to draw this game to achieve my goal.\nSo, if you could do both of a favor, could please stop putting SC obtainment as your primary goal? We are going for logic, and most effective plan here. France shouldn't take this long to defeat... So, let me explain you my logics so you know I'm not randomly throwing around crap to get me Sc's. This is the plan, as I see it. Picardy and Brest support hold each other, allowing Irish Sea to get to MAO safely. Getting a fleet to MAO gurantees a succesful move from Belgium to Burgundy, still allowing you Belgium. So, end result is, you still get Belgium by the build cycle, and we're in a stronger position, etc.. If you need me to re-explain any of this, I'd be happy to. But, do you see where my exsasperation lies? We are allies, I am doing stuff on the agenda of both of us, whereas you are looking at yourself. If we are to be strong allies, we need to be communicating well, and in complete understanding of each others logics. At this point, your moves seem very illogical to me...

I admire your tenacity - a characteristic I share - and wonder to what bets you're referring.\n\nI also appreciate the disband, and shall honour what I proposed. We need to find the ideal set of moves, but I'll get there in a moment. I'd just like to point out that Turkey, who has been comprehensibly lobbying for an attack on Austria, has just remarked on how unstoppable England and Germany, as allies, are bond to become sooner rather than later. While I said nothing, it does calm me to know my concerns (namely, regarding Germany) are well founded, meaning my choices are, apparently, wise.\n\nNow, as for moves, we're in a tight spot. There are many possibilities, and even supporting you into Burgundy (Gas-bur and Spa-gas) is not completely sure to give you Paris. You could consider asking Russia to launch an attack on Munich, in order to tie German units there, though I'd advise caution regarding my allegiance :)\n\nBut our main (perhaps only?) advantage is that, as far as I know, Germany is unaware of my stance. Meaning I can know precisely what moves Germany intends to order, and perhaps steer them in our favour.\n\nI assume England will support Bel-pic, so that Brest falls to them in the Autumn. If Germany is not concerned about covering Paris, I can suggest Bur-gas, Mars S Gol-spa. Seems feasible. The plan is good in that, even if you do not attack Marseilles or resist in Gas and sneak into Paris, they can surely support Pic-bre, offsetting that loss, while you're also weakened in Iberia, meaning Germany may fall for it.\n\nOn the other hand, instead of supporting Gol-spa, I can support Spa-gas. This means you'll not only sneak into Paris, but now your two armies will be able to support hold Brest, while only one of these supports can be cut by Germany. You keep your 3 Scs, Germany goes down one and our position is, albeit mildly, improved!\n\nI'll suggest these moves to Germany, but I'm waiting for your ideas before committing to it.\r"

I appreciate that you are willing to set aside your unease and work in concert. I will not let you down so easily.\n\non burgundy - part of it was to assure you of my intent and motivation. part of it was to counter a potential French stab that I was concerned with. regarding russia - you can lay your heart at east on that front as well. I have a some tricks up my sleeve that you will be happy with, but just like the burgundy situation, i'd rather not divulge them as it does not benefit either of us.\n\nhowever, I do have some 'marching orders' for you to consider... I want you to move Sweden to Norway. this will be KEY in making sure we get what we want and will likely produce a build for you this year. so please trust me. I am sorry I can not divulge ALL my moves to you nor tell you what Russia's moves are for fear that you will change your moves. if we continue down this path of trust and I do not see you turning on me with French (or Russian) help, then in a short season as you see my moves and I see your further commitment, then I can tell you the why and how of the moves as well. I know this is a big request, but as you said yourself, if I was going to stab you for a measly gain in edi and to be stuck between russia and france, I could do that anyways right? so please trust me.\n\nin the south, York to Lvp is critical and I expect it to get in.\n\nI think either wal or lon to ech can work fine. but I personally think Lon to Ech is much more important right now. yes, you want to get north and I will readily cede it to you but first and foremost, I hope you take Irish. the main reason I say not to move wal is that there is a scenario under which wal may be needed to cover liverpool in the fall and if you don't have the unit in wal, it could throw my ability to help you take norway difficult.\n\nin the end, i wont be prickly on this particular point, for now I will put in North support London to Ech, but after you have considered things further, if you still feel you MUST move wal, then I will change my support. but Swe to Nwy and York to Lvp are key.\n\nas for my own moves in the south, suffice to say that I do not want to give you my moves for the same reasons you outlined yourself. no gain for you and if france blocks me then it would make me doubt you right? so best not to worry about it.\n\nlike I said, I have reason to believe that russia will not have the free hand in the south that he hopes to have. let me leave it at that.\n\nI'm committed to us... in great part because I can write you a long message like this and I know you'll respond in kind - with detail and expertise. I like that and find that games with partners such as you are far more fun and enjoyable than games with partners who write a few lines and can't think in abstract terms about the 'bigger picture' or about strategy. so thanks for your diplomatic style. ;)\r"

You're more or less asking me to walk blinded through a tight and twisting corridor with only sparse words coming from you to aid my progress... I'm not comfortable with this and it's not something I'll keep doing for much longer, as I'm sure you'll understand (and your message seems to indicate that you're aware of that, so I'm not too worried).\n\nSwe will go to Nor, Yor to Liv, Lon to Channel and Wales to Irish. The last move will either bounce and cover both the Irish and Wales, or set me up to take MAO in a year or two. The first alternative is more likely...\n\nRussia trusts you a lot, but is nonetheless plotting your demise. I'm not saying that so to gain your trust as there's really not much for me to do on that front: either you're in fact allied with me or you're not, but it's not a question of trust that will decide that for you at this point. No, it's more simply that I'm trying to help the person I consider my ally be aware of possible dangers. Russia has explicitly talked about how we share an interest in controlling your growth. He would have me move in such a way as to force you into a tough spot in the fall, more or less forced to support him into Sweden (which he is convinced you will do).\n\nFrance is not trustworthy and I'm not hearing much about him from other powers. As far as I know from what he told me, his plan is still to set himself up against you and vacate my seas. Like I said, I put very little faith in his words, but I did see them as an opportunity to throw the WT out there once more. I told him that we had not yet suffered too greatly at the hands of one another and that our positions are still quite solid if we were to decide for that kind of strategy. His reply was that we needed, among other things, to break AR and see to it that Italy doesn't have much to hope from A or T.\n\nA WT could still be tempting to me, of course, but for now I'm only committed to this. I suggest we see how the next phase turn out where France is concerned and sell the WT if it seems likely that he'll play for it. Once the WT is on track, if that should happen, you and I would need to work right away on how we would take France out of the mix...\n\nI take great comfort in your words and find many reasons in your messages to believe that you are indeed as dedicated to EG as I am. I'd like to offer more input, but since you seem to have the situation quite under control and do not feel ready to share intel with me, there's not much I can say that wouldn't ring like futile assumptions.\r"
