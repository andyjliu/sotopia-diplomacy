Indeed, our units are near each other's borders. I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on how we can cooperate or find a mutually beneficial agreement.\n2 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: I've been looking at the board, and I think it's clear that we both have interests in the Balkans. I was thinking that we could come to an agreement where you support my move into Rumania, and in return, I could support your move into Serbia. This would give us both a stronger foothold in the region and allow us to focus on other areas of the board. What do you think?\n3 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: I appreciate your proposal, Germany. However, I'm not convinced that supporting your move into Rumania would be beneficial for me. I'm more interested in exploring possibilities of cooperation in the north, perhaps supporting each other's moves into Sweden or Denmark. What are your thoughts on that?\n4 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: I understand your concerns about Rumania, but I think supporting each other's moves in the north would be a mistake.

This would give us both a stronger foothold in the region and allow us to focus on other areas of the board.\n5 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: I appreciate your compromise, Germany. However, I'm still not convinced that supporting your move into Galicia would be beneficial for me. I think it's crucial for me to maintain a strong presence in the Balkans.

This would give us both a stronger foothold in the region and allow us to focus on other areas of the board.\n6 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: I understand your concerns about Galicia, but I'm not willing to support your move into Bulgaria without getting something in return.

I've been watching your moves as well, and I think we can definitely work together to achieve our goals. However, I'm not sure I'm interested in blocking Austria's expansion into the Balkans. What do you propose we do instead?\n2 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: I understand your hesitation, but I think it's crucial we address the Austrian threat. They're already making moves in the Balkans, and if we don't act soon, they'll be unstoppable. How about we work together to take out Austria's center in Serbia? I can provide military support from my unit in Munich, and you could provide assistance from your unit in Greece. We could then split the spoils and ensure a more balanced power dynamic in the region.\n3 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: I understand your concerns about Austria's expansion, but I'm not convinced that taking out their center in Serbia is the best move for us right now.

To clarify, by 'securing our borders' I mean a mutual defense pact where we agree to protect each other's centers from Austrian aggression.

What do you think about supporting Italy's move to Trieste?\n3 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I think supporting Italy's move to Trieste is a good idea, but we need to make sure Austria is committed to fighting Germany as well. Can you guarantee Austria's support in Galicia?\n4 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I can guarantee Austria's support in Galicia. In fact, I was thinking of moving my army in Bul to Rum to support Russia's defense against Germany. This would also allow us to put more pressure on Austria and limit their ability to respond to Italy's move to Trieste. What do you think about this plan?\n5 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: That sounds like a solid plan, supporting Italy's move to Trieste and Austria's defense in Galicia. I'll move my army in Vie to Gal and my fleet in Rum to Bla to ensure we have a strong presence in the region. Let's work together to limit Germany's growth.\n6 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: Great, it sounds like we have a solid plan in place. Let's make sure to coordinate our moves and provide each other with the necessary support. I'll make sure to move my army in Bul to Rum as discussed. What's your plan for the fleet in Rum, will you move it to Bla as mentioned earlier?\n7 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: Yes, I'll move my fleet in Rum to Bla as planned. Let's make sure to coordinate our moves and provide each other with the necessary support to limit Germany's growth.\n8 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: Everything looks good for this turn. Let's review our plan again to make sure we're on the same page. You'll move your army in Vie to Gal and your fleet in Rum to Bla, while I'll move my army in Bul to Rum. We'll provide support to Italy's move to Trieste and Austria's defense in Galicia. Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.\n9 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: Yes, everything looks good. I'm confident that our coordinated efforts will pay off. Let's make sure to stay in touch and adjust our plans as needed to counter Germany's moves.\n10 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: Everything looks good, let's execute our plan and review the results at the next turn. I'll make sure to keep an eye on Germany's movements and adjust our strategy accordingly.\n11 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: Great, it seems like our plan is working well. Germany's growth has been limited and we've made some gains in the Balkans. Let's continue to coordinate our efforts and review our plan for the next turn. Are there any adjustments we need to make to counter Germany's next move?\n12 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: Yes, I agree that our plan is working well. Let's continue to coordinate our efforts and review our plan for the next turn. I think we should also consider supporting Russia's defense against Germany, what's your thought on that?\n13 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I completely agree with supporting Russia's defense against Germany. Let's discuss specific army movements that can be made this turn to ensure our defenses are strong. What do you think about moving my army in Sev to Rum to support your defense?\n14 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: That's a great idea, supporting Russia's defense against Germany.

What do you think about that?\n15 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: That's a great plan, moving my army in Sev to Rum and your fleet in Con to Bla will definitely strengthen our defenses against Germany. Let's also consider moving my army in Gal to Vie to support Austria and limit Germany's expansion.\n16 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I think we should also consider moving my army in Bul to Sev to support Russia's defense against Germany. What do you think about that?\n17 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: That sounds like a great plan, moving my army in Sev to Rum and your fleet in Con to Bla will definitely strengthen our defenses against Germany.

What do you think about moving my fleet in Bla to Con to provide additional support to Turkey?\n18 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I think we're on the right track. Let's review our plan again to make sure we're on the same page. We'll continue to support Italy's move to Trieste and Austria's defense in Galicia, while also strengthening our defenses against Germany. Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.\n19 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I'm glad we're on the same page. Let's execute our plan and review the results at the next turn. I'll make sure to keep an eye on Germany's movements and adjust our strategy accordingly.\n20 TURKEY -> RUSSIA: I think we've made good progress so far.

What do you propose we do with Austria's centers once we take them down?\n2 GERMANY -> FRANCE: That's a fair question, France. If we work together to take down Austria, I propose we split the spoils 50/50. We can discuss the specifics of which centers go to whom, but I think that's a fair deal considering our current positions.\n3 FRANCE -> GERMANY: That sounds like a reasonable proposal, Germany. However, I think it would be more beneficial for me to support your fleet in Denmark if you agree to support my army in Munich.

Perhaps we could discuss the specifics of our fleet movements and make sure we're on the same page.\n10 TURKEY -> FRANCE: I agree, coordinating our fleet movements in the Mediterranean is crucial for the success of our plan. I propose that we move my fleet in the Black Sea to support your fleet in the Aegean Sea, and in return, you can move your fleet in the Western Mediterranean to support my fleet in the Eastern Mediterranean. This way, we can ensure a strong presence in both areas and set ourselves up for success in our campaign against Russia.\n11 FRANCE -> TURKEY: That sounds like a great plan, Turkey.

        "dialogue_without_flausible": "0 TURKEY -> ITALY: Hi Italy, I see we're at a crossroads here. I've been thinking, and I believe we can still work together to take down France. I'm willing to offer you a deal: if you support my move into Venice, I'll make sure to keep France at bay and give you a chance to regroup. What do you think?\n1 ITALY -> TURKEY: I'm not sure I trust you, Turkey. You've already taken Naples from me, and now you're asking me to support your move into Venice? What's to stop you from taking that from me too? I need some guarantees before I make any deals.\n2 TURKEY -> ITALY: I understand your concerns, Italy. Let me propose a compromise: if you support my move into Venice, I'll not only keep France at bay but also offer you a guarantee that I won't take any of your remaining centers. I'll even provide you with a temporary alliance to ensure your safety. What do you think?\n3 ITALY -> TURKEY: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Turkey. However, I still have doubts about your intentions. Can you explain why you're so keen on taking Venice? Is it just a strategic move or is there something more to it?\n4 TURKEY -> ITALY: I understand your concerns, Italy. Taking Venice is indeed a strategic move, but it's also a crucial step in keeping France at bay. With Venice, I can ensure that France doesn't get too close to your remaining centers.

Can you offer me something more tangible, like a temporary concession of a center or a specific agreement to work together against France?\n6 TURKEY -> ITALY: I understand your concerns, Italy. I'm willing to offer you a temporary concession of a center. How about I give you Greece in exchange for your support in taking Venice? This way, you'll gain a center and we can work together to take down France.\n7 ITALY -> TURKEY: I'm still unsure about your intentions, Turkey. Giving me Greece is a nice gesture, but I need more assurance that you won't turn on me once we take down France. Can you offer me a more permanent alliance, perhaps a mutual defense pact, to ensure our cooperation?\n8 TURKEY -> ITALY: I understand your concerns, Italy. A mutual defense pact is a big commitment, but I'm willing to make it if it means we can work together to take down France. Let me propose a pact where we agree to defend each other's centers against French aggression for the next two turns. This way, we can both focus on taking down France without worrying about each other. What do you think?\n9 ITALY -> TURKEY: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Turkey. A mutual defense pact sounds like a good idea, but I need to think about it carefully. Can you give me a turn to consider it and discuss it with my advisors? I'll get back to you with a decision by the next turn.\n10 TURKEY -> ITALY: I understand that you need time to think, Italy. Take all the time you need, but let me remind you that the fate of our alliance hangs in the balance. The longer we wait, the stronger France becomes.

Will you support my move into Venice and work with me to take down France, or will you continue to hesitate and risk everything?\n13 ITALY -> TURKEY: I'm still unsure about your intentions, Turkey.

I've been reviewing the current board situation, and I think it's essential for us to discuss our moves for this turn. As Germany, I'm looking to make some strategic advancements that could benefit both our countries. I'd like to propose a potential alliance to ensure our mutual growth and security. What are your thoughts on this, and are you open to discussing some possible moves that could benefit us both?\n1 FRANCE -> GERMANY: Hello Germany, I appreciate your willingness to discuss a potential alliance. As France, I'm always open to exploring opportunities for mutual growth and security. However, I'd like to know more about your proposed alliance and what specific moves you have in mind for this turn. What do you think would be a beneficial move for both our countries?\n2 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I appreciate your willingness to consider an alliance, France. As I see it, a potential move that could benefit both our countries is for me to move my fleet from NWG to EDI, supporting your army in PIC. This would not only secure a vital center for you but also create a strong defensive position for both our countries. What do you think about this proposal?\n3 FRANCE -> GERMANY: That's an interesting proposal, Germany. However, I'm not convinced that moving your fleet to EDI would be the best move for both our countries. I think it would be more beneficial if you were to support my army in BUR, allowing me to take MUN and create a stronger position for France. What do you think about this alternative proposal?\n4 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I understand your concerns, France. Supporting your army in BUR would indeed be a beneficial move for France. However, I'm still hesitant to give up on the opportunity to secure EDI. Would you be open to a compromise, where I move my fleet to NTH instead, supporting your northern flank and keeping the pressure on England? This way, we can still work together while also considering our individual interests.\n5 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Germany. Moving your fleet to NTH could be a good alternative, but I'd like to propose another option. What if you were to support my army in BUR with your army in PRU, while also moving your army in MUN to hold? This would allow me to take MUN and create a stronger position for France, while also keeping the pressure on England. What do you think about this proposal?\n6 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I understand your proposal, France. Supporting your army in BUR with my army in PRU and moving my army in MUN to hold is an interesting option. However, I'd like to counter-propose that you support my army in PRU with your army in PIC, allowing me to take BER and creating a stronger position for Germany. What do you think about this alternative?\n7 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I'm interested in your counter-proposal, Germany. Supporting your army in PRU with my army in PIC could be a good option, but I'd like to know more about your long-term plans and how this move would benefit France in the future. Can you tell me more about your strategy and how we can work together to achieve our goals?\n8 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I understand your concerns, France. Supporting your army in BUR with my army in PRU and moving my army in MUN to hold is a viable option, but I'd like to reiterate the benefits of supporting my army in PRU with your army in PIC. This move would not only create a stronger position for Germany but also put pressure on England. Let's discuss the long-term benefits of this move and how it can lead to a stronger alliance between our countries.\n9 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I understand your point, Germany. However, I'd like to reiterate the importance of supporting my army in BUR. This move would not only create a stronger position for France but also put pressure on England. Let's discuss the long-term benefits of this move and how it can lead to a stronger alliance between our countries.\n10 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I understand your concerns, France. Let's discuss the benefits of both options in more detail. Supporting your army in BUR would indeed create a stronger position for France, but supporting my army in PRU with your army in PIC would also put pressure on England and create a stronger position for Germany. Perhaps we can find a way to compromise and achieve both goals. What do you think about a joint attack on England, with your army in BUR supporting my army in PRU, and my fleet in NWG supporting your army in PIC?\n11 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I think we've discussed the options thoroughly, Germany. Let's summarize the benefits of each move and make a decision. Supporting my army in BUR would create a stronger position for France, while supporting your army in PRU with my army in PIC would put pressure on England and create a stronger position for Germany. I'm willing to compromise and find a way to achieve both goals. What do you propose we do?\n12 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I think we've discussed the options thoroughly, France. Let's make a decision. I propose we support your army in BUR with my army in PRU, and my fleet in NWG supports your army in PIC. This way, we can create a stronger position for both our countries and put pressure on England. What do you think?\n13 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I think we've discussed the options thoroughly, Germany. I agree to support each other's armies as proposed. Let's finalize the moves and make them official. I'll support your army in PRU with my army in PIC, and you'll support my army in BUR with your army in PRU. This way, we can create a stronger position for both our countries and put pressure on England. Let's make it happen.\n14 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I'm glad we could come to an agreement, France. Let's make our moves official and work together to put pressure on England. I'll support your army in BUR with my army in PRU, and my fleet in NWG will support your army in PIC.

What are your thoughts on this, and how do you see our alliance evolving in the coming turns?\n19 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I completely agree, Germany. Discussing our long-term strategy and how we can continue to support each other in the future is crucial. I believe our alliance can be a powerful force in the game, and with careful planning, we can achieve great things. What specific plans do you have in mind for our future cooperation?\n20 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I completely agree, France. Discussing our long-term strategy and how we can continue to support each other in the future is crucial. I believe our alliance can be a powerful force in the game, and with careful planning, we can achieve great things.

Would you be willing to commit to not attacking me in the North Sea in exchange for my support in taking down Italy?\n4 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I understand your concerns about the North Sea, and I'm willing to make a commitment to not attack you in the North Sea in exchange for your support in taking down Italy. Let's work together to achieve our goals.\n5 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I'm glad we have an agreement on taking down Italy and not attacking each other in the North Sea. Now, let's discuss the specific moves we can make this turn to achieve our goals. I propose that you support my army in Spain and I'll support your army in Piedmont. What do you think?\n6 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I think your proposal sounds like a good plan, France. Supporting your army in Spain and having you support my army in Piedmont will help us both achieve our goals.

Our alliance has been crucial in taking down Italy and securing our supply centers. Looking ahead, I think we should continue to work together to expand our territories and prevent any other powers from becoming too strong.

What are your thoughts on this matter?\n10 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I completely agree with your assessment, France. An alliance with England could be beneficial in securing the North Sea, but we need to be cautious not to strengthen them too much.

Moving my army in Vienna to Budapest could definitely give us a stronger presence in the region. However, I'm not sure if it's the best move for this turn.

I wanted to discuss our current board position and see if we can come to some mutually beneficial agreements. Specifically, I'm interested in exploring ways to work together to counter the growing threat of Austria. Would you be open to discussing some potential moves that could help us both?\n1 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: Bonjour England, I'm doing well, thank you for asking. I'm more than happy to discuss ways to counter the growing threat of Austria. In fact, I've been thinking about it a lot lately. I've noticed that Austria has a strong presence in the Balkans, and it's only a matter of time before they start making moves towards our borders. I think it would be beneficial for both of us to work together to prevent that from happening. What specific moves were you thinking of making to counter Austria's influence?\n2 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I completely agree with your assessment of the situation. In fact, I've been thinking that we could work together to take out Austria's unit in Rumania. If you were to move your unit from Greece to Rumania, and I were to move my unit from Sweden to Rumania, we could take out Austria's unit and gain a strategic advantage. What do you think?\n3 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: That's an interesting proposal, England. I like the idea of taking out Austria's unit in Rumania. However, I'm concerned about the potential risks involved. If we move our units to Rumania, we'll be leaving our borders vulnerable to Austrian counter-attacks. I think we need to consider a more strategic approach. What if we were to coordinate a simultaneous attack on Austria's units in Serbia and Greece instead? That way, we could weaken Austria's position in the Balkans without exposing ourselves to unnecessary risks. What do you think?\n4 ENGLAND -> FRANCE: I understand your concerns about the risks involved, France. However, I think we need to weigh the risks against the potential benefits. If we can successfully take out Austria's unit in Rumania, it would give us a significant advantage in the region. Perhaps we could compromise and move my unit from Sweden to Rumania, while you move your unit from Greece to Serbia, and then we can reassess the situation after this turn. What do you think?\n5 FRANCE -> ENGLAND: I think that's a reasonable compromise, England. Let's move your unit from Sweden to Rumania, and I'll move my unit from Greece to Serbia.

What specific regions or centers are you thinking of supporting me in, and what kind of temporary alliance are you proposing to slow down Austria's growth?\n4 TURKEY -> AUSTRIA: I was thinking of supporting you in Greece or Serbia, in exchange for your support in Bulgaria or Rumania.

Attacking Venice to Tyrolia would cut the support Germany has on Vienna, making it an easier target for you to take. As for what's in it for me, I would gain a strategic advantage by weakening Germany's position and creating an opportunity for us to work together to take them down. It's a win-win situation.\n2 TURKEY -> ITALY: I see your point, but I'm still not convinced. What's to stop Germany from simply moving their unit from Tyrolia to Vienna to replace the lost support? And how do you plan to ensure that I'll be able to take Vienna successfully after you attack Tyrolia?\n3 ITALY -> TURKEY: I understand your concerns about Germany replacing the lost support, but I believe it's a risk worth taking.

I've been thinking about our previous agreements and I'm wondering if we can revisit the idea of a potential alliance between Germany and England.

However, I'd like to discuss some specific ways in which we can mutually benefit each other.

Perhaps we could coordinate our movements to ensure that they don't gain too much ground. What are your thoughts on this?\n3 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I think that's a great idea, Germany. Limiting France's growth would certainly benefit both of our countries. I was thinking that we could work together to take out some of their northern centers, perhaps even take Brest or Picardy.

I've been considering our current board position, and I think it would be advantageous for us to work together to secure the Munich center. If your army in Kiel were to move to Munich, it would not only give you a strategic location but also provide a buffer against potential threats from France. What are your thoughts on this proposal?\n2 GERMANY -> ITALY: That's an interesting proposal, Italy. I think moving my army to Munich could be beneficial for both of us. However, I'm concerned about the potential threat from France. Would you be willing to support my army in Munich with one of your own, perhaps from Venice or Trieste? This would provide additional security and allow us to focus on expanding our territories.\n3 ITALY -> GERMANY: I understand your concerns about the potential threat from France, Germany. Supporting your army in Munich with one of my own from Venice or Trieste is a possibility. However, I would like to propose a counter-offer. If you were to support my army in Trieste, I could potentially move my army from Venice to Munich, providing the necessary support for your army. This would not only secure Munich but also give us a stronger foothold in the region. What are your thoughts on this proposal?\n4 GERMANY -> ITALY: I think your counter-offer is an interesting one, Italy. Supporting your army in Trieste could be beneficial for both of us. However, I would like to propose a slight modification. If I were to support your army in Trieste, would you be willing to support my army in Munich with your army from Venice, and also provide a guarantee that you won't move your army from Trieste to Vienna? This would provide additional security for both of us and allow us to focus on expanding our territories.\n5 ITALY -> GERMANY: I think your modification is reasonable, Germany. I agree to support your army in Munich with my army from Venice, and I guarantee that I won't move my army from Trieste to Vienna. In return, I expect you to support my army in Trieste. Let's work together to secure these key centers and strengthen our position on the board.\n6 GERMANY -> ITALY: Excellent, Italy! I'm glad we could come to an agreement. I'll support your army in Trieste, and I expect you to support my army in Munich. Let's make sure to coordinate our moves and secure these key centers. Shall we discuss our next moves and how we can continue to work together to expand our territories?\n7 ITALY -> GERMANY: I'm glad we have come to an agreement, Germany. I think our coordination will pay off in the long run. Let's make sure to keep the lines of communication open and continue to work together to achieve our goals. Perhaps we can discuss potential moves for the next turn and how we can further solidify our positions.\n8 GERMANY -> ITALY: I'm thinking ahead to the next turn, Italy. Considering our current positions, I think it would be beneficial for us to discuss potential moves that would allow us to expand our territories further. Perhaps we could work together to take advantage of any weaknesses in our opponents' positions. What are your thoughts on this?\n9 ITALY -> GERMANY: I agree that we should discuss potential moves for the next turn. Considering our current positions, I think it would be beneficial for us to focus on securing the Vienna center. If your army in Kiel were to move to Berlin, it would provide a strong foothold for us to launch a joint attack on Vienna. What are your thoughts on this proposal?\n10 GERMANY -> ITALY: I think that's a great idea, Italy. Moving my army from Kiel to Berlin would provide a strong foothold for us to launch a joint attack on Vienna. I'm willing to make that move if you're willing to support me with your army from Venice. Let's work together to secure Vienna and continue to expand our territories.\n11 ITALY -> GERMANY: I'm glad we're on the same page, Germany. Moving your army from Kiel to Berlin will provide a strong foothold for us to launch a joint attack on Vienna. I'll make sure to support you with my army from Venice.

What are your thoughts on this?\n17 ITALY -> GERMANY: I agree with your assessment of France's expansion in the north, Germany. It's essential that we maintain a strong presence in the region to counter their growth. Perhaps we could discuss potential moves to limit their expansion and secure our own positions.\n18 GERMANY -> ITALY: I completely agree with your assessment, Italy. Limiting France's expansion in the north is crucial for our growth. Perhaps we could discuss potential moves to support Austria in holding off France's advance. What are your thoughts on this?\n19 ITALY -> GERMANY: I agree that supporting Austria in holding off France's advance is crucial for our growth.

I'm happy to discuss potential moves that benefit both our positions. Consolidating your position in the north sounds like a great goal. I was thinking that if you were to move your army in Denmark to Sweden, it would not only help you but also provide a buffer against any potential English aggression.

However, I was also thinking that if you were to move your army in Rumania to Galicia, it would help me feel more secure about my southern border.

However, I was thinking that if you were to move your army in Holstein to Berlin, it would help me feel more secure about my western border.

Moving my army in Moscow to Ukraine would indeed help you feel more secure about your eastern border, but I'd like to propose a slight modification.

A solo victory is not a desirable outcome for either of us, and I'm willing to collaborate to achieve a 2-way or 3-way draw.

What are your thoughts on this, and are you willing to work together to address this issue?\n2 GERMANY -> AUSTRIA: I understand your concerns about Italy, and I agree that we should work together to limit their growth. One possible move could be for me to support your attack on Italy's Venecia, while you support my move on France's Marseilles.

What do you think about this proposal?\n3 AUSTRIA -> GERMANY: I think your proposal has some merit, Germany. However, I'm not convinced that supporting your move on Marseilles is the best option for me right now.

What else can you offer me to make it worth my while?\n1 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: I understand your reluctance to give up London, Russia. However, I'd like to propose a compromise. If you were to move your army from SWE to NWY, it would put pressure on England and potentially force them to respond.

What specific benefits do you have in mind for our cooperation? And how do you propose we divide the spoils of our joint effort?\n2 RUSSIA -> TURKEY: I think a joint effort could lead to a more stable board for both of us.

As you've been observing my moves, I'm sure you're aware that I've been focusing on securing my borders and expanding my influence. I'm open to discussing potential alliances, but I need to ensure that any agreement benefits France's interests. What specific proposals do you have in mind?\n2 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I understand your concerns, France. I believe we can work together to secure our borders and expand our influence. Specifically, I propose that we form a mutual defense pact, where we agree to support each other in case of an attack. Additionally, I suggest that we coordinate our army movements to put pressure on Italy and Austria, which would benefit both our countries. What do you think?\n3 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I appreciate your proposal, Germany. A mutual defense pact and coordinated army movements against Italy and Austria could be beneficial for both our countries. However, I need to ensure that any agreement doesn't compromise France's interests. Can you specify how you envision our armies working together to put pressure on Italy and Austria? What specific actions do you propose we take this turn?\n4 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I'm glad you're open to coordinating our efforts, France. This turn, I propose that we work together to put pressure on Italy. Specifically, I suggest that you move your army in Spain to support my army in Munich, and in return, I'll support your army in Burgundy. This would allow us to put significant pressure on Italy and potentially gain a center or two. What do you think?\n5 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I like your proposal, Germany. Moving my army in Spain to support your army in Munich and having you support my army in Burgundy could put significant pressure on Italy.

To further solidify our position against Italy, I propose that we also coordinate our fleets to put pressure on the Italian coast.

Taking down Germany is definitely a priority, but I think we can achieve more than that. With your help, we can create a strong alliance that will give us a significant advantage on the board. Specifically, if you move to NAO, we can work together to take down Germany's units in the north.

I must say, the current board position looks quite interesting. I was thinking, perhaps we could discuss some potential moves that would benefit both our countries. Specifically, I was considering supporting your army in Greece to move to Albania, and in return, you could support my army in Budapest to move to Vienna. What are your thoughts on this proposal?\n1 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: Russia, I appreciate your proposal, but I'm not sure if I'm willing to give up Vienna so easily. What's in it for me if I support your army in Budapest? What guarantees do I have that you won't stab me in the back?\n2 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I understand your concerns, Austria. Let me propose an alternative. How about we arrange a mutual support, where I support your army in Greece to move to Albania, and in return, you support my army in Budapest to move to Rumania? This way, we both gain a center without giving up any of our current positions.\n3 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: Russia, I like the sound of your alternative proposal, but I'm still not convinced. What's to stop you from supporting another country's army in Rumania instead of mine once we've made the move? Can you offer me any guarantees or assurances that our mutual support will hold?\n4 RUSSIA -> AUSTRIA: I understand your concerns, Austria. Perhaps I can offer you a guarantee in the form of a joint declaration of our mutual support.

This way, you can be assured that I will follow through on my promise and support your army in Albania. What do you think?\n5 AUSTRIA -> RUSSIA: I'm willing to accept your proposal, Russia.

This would increase our chances of success and give us a stronger bargaining position. What do you think?\n11 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: I appreciate your plan, Russia.

I'm open to discussing a potential alliance or cooperation. However, I'd like to know more about your intentions and what you're willing to offer to France in terms of mutual benefit. What specific regions are you looking to expand into, and how do you envision our cooperation unfolding?\n2 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I understand your concerns, France. As Germany, I'm primarily interested in expanding into the Low Countries, specifically Belgium and the Netherlands. I believe our cooperation could be mutually beneficial, as we could work together to limit the influence of other powers in the region. Perhaps we could discuss a potential agreement where France supports my move into Belgium in exchange for my support in the Mediterranean?\n3 FRANCE -> GERMANY: That's an interesting proposal, Germany. I'm not opposed to supporting your move into Belgium, but I'd like to discuss the specifics of how that would play out. Would you be willing to commit to supporting my move into Spain, and perhaps even providing military assistance to help me secure that region?\n4 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I understand your concerns about Spain, France. However, I'm not sure I'm willing to commit to providing military assistance just yet. Perhaps we could discuss a more limited agreement, where I support your move into Spain in exchange for your support in Belgium, but without any additional military commitments. This way, we can both achieve our goals without overextending ourselves.\n5 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I understand your perspective, Germany. While I appreciate your willingness to support my move into Spain, I'm still hesitant to agree to a limited agreement. I think it's essential to consider the long-term implications of our cooperation. Would you be willing to discuss a more comprehensive alliance that addresses our mutual interests in the Mediterranean and the Low Countries?\n6 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I understand your concerns, France. I'm willing to consider a more comprehensive alliance, but I need to ensure that it aligns with my goals of expanding into the Low Countries and limiting the influence of other powers in the region.

What are your thoughts on this proposal?\n8 GERMANY -> FRANCE: I think we're making good progress, France. A mutual defense pact in the Mediterranean and joint military operations to limit the influence of other powers in the region could be very beneficial to both our countries. Let's discuss the specifics of how we can work together to achieve our goals. Perhaps we could also consider a agreement where we would not attack each other's units in the Low Countries and the Mediterranean, to ensure a secure environment for our expansion.\n9 FRANCE -> GERMANY: I think we're close to reaching an agreement, Germany. Let's summarize the terms of our proposed alliance to ensure we're on the same page. You would support my move into Spain, and I would support your move into Belgium. We would also agree to a mutual defense pact in the Mediterranean and joint military operations to limit the influence of other powers in the region. Additionally, we would not attack each other's units in the Low Countries and the Mediterranean.

If we work together, we can prevent them from getting too powerful. What are your thoughts on this?\n1 ITALY -> FRANCE: I agree that Austria is a threat, but I'm more concerned about France's position right now. If France were to support me in taking Greece, it would give me a strong foothold in the Balkans and allow me to focus on Austria. What do you think about supporting me in Greece this turn?\n2 FRANCE -> ITALY: I'm willing to consider supporting you in Greece, but I'd like to know more about your plans for Austria. How do you plan to tackle them, and how can I benefit from our cooperation?\n3 ITALY -> FRANCE: I understand your concerns, France. If we work together, we can definitely limit Austria's growth. Supporting me in Greece would not only give me a foothold in the Balkans but also create a buffer zone between us and Austria. In return, I can offer you support in taking Belgium or the Netherlands, which would strengthen your position in the north. What do you think about this proposal?\n4 FRANCE -> ITALY: I like your proposal, Italy. Supporting you in Greece would not only help you but also limit Austria's growth. In return, I would appreciate your support in taking the Netherlands, which would give me a stronger foothold in the north.

How do you plan to handle Austria's potential response to us taking Trieste? And what's in it for me if we succeed?\n9 ITALY -> FRANCE: I understand your concerns about the bigger picture, France. Taking Trieste would indeed require careful consideration of Austria's potential response. However, I believe that with our combined strength, we can manage the risk.

Meanwhile, our joint move in the North Sea and Baltic regions will secure our positions and limit Austria's growth. I'll make sure to move my fleet from Kiel to Holland as planned. Let's work together to make this turn a success!\n5 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I'm glad we're on the same page, Germany. Now that we have a plan in place, I'd like to discuss some longer-term strategies. How do you think we can work together to limit Italy's growth and prevent them from becoming a threat to our interests?\n6 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: Excellent, England! I'm glad we're on the same page. To further limit Italy's growth, I think we could discuss a potential alliance with France. Perhaps we could offer them a deal to work together to contain Italy's expansion in the Mediterranean. What are your thoughts on this proposal?\n7 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: That's an interesting idea, Germany. I think an alliance with France could be beneficial in limiting Italy's growth. However, I'd like to discuss the details of such an alliance and how it would align with our current goals. What kind of deal do you propose we offer France, and how would we ensure their cooperation?\n8 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I think we should also consider offering France a guarantee of security in the Mediterranean, in exchange for their cooperation in limiting Italy's growth. This would not only benefit us but also provide France with a sense of security and stability in the region. What are your thoughts on this proposal?\n9 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I agree that offering France a guarantee of security in the Mediterranean could be a good idea, but I'd like to discuss the potential risks and consequences of such an alliance. How do you think we can ensure that France will uphold their end of the deal and not use this opportunity to expand their own influence in the region?\n10 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I understand your concerns, England. To mitigate the risks, we could propose a conditional alliance with France, where we offer them a guarantee of security in the Mediterranean only if they agree to work with us to limit Italy's growth. This way, we can ensure that France has a vested interest in upholding their end of the deal. What are your thoughts on this proposal?\n11 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I think that's a reasonable proposal, Germany. A conditional alliance with France could be a good way to limit Italy's growth while also ensuring France's cooperation. However, I'd like to discuss the specifics of the deal and how we can ensure that France will uphold their end of the bargain. What kind of conditions do you propose we attach to the alliance, and how will we enforce them?\n12 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I think we're making good progress on our proposal, England. To further solidify our alliance, I'd like to discuss the specifics of how we can work together to limit Italy's growth. Perhaps we could discuss a potential joint move in the Mediterranean to put pressure on Italy's southern flank. What are your thoughts on this proposal?\n13 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I think a joint move in the Mediterranean could be a great way to put pressure on Italy's southern flank. What specific moves do you propose we make to achieve this goal?\n14 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I think a joint move in the Mediterranean is a great idea, England. How about we move our fleets to the Gulf of Lyon and the Tyrrhenian Sea to put pressure on Italy's southern flank? This would not only limit Italy's growth but also give us a strong foothold in the region. What do you think about this proposal?\n15 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I think that's a great proposal, Germany. Moving our fleets to the Gulf of Lyon and the Tyrrhenian Sea would put significant pressure on Italy's southern flank. However, I'd like to discuss how we can ensure that our joint move doesn't leave us vulnerable to attacks from other countries. Perhaps we could also discuss a potential agreement to provide mutual support in case of an attack.\n16 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I completely agree with your concerns about ensuring our joint move in the Mediterranean doesn't leave us vulnerable to attacks from other countries. Perhaps we could discuss a potential agreement to provide mutual support in case of an attack, and also consider coordinating with France to ensure they're aware of our joint move and can provide additional support if needed. What are your thoughts on this proposal?\n17 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I think that's a great idea, Germany. Coordinating with France to ensure they're aware of our joint move and can provide additional support if needed is a wise decision. Let's work together to finalize the details of our agreement and make sure we're on the same page before making our moves.\n18 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I'm glad we're making progress on our proposal, England. To further solidify our alliance, I'd like to discuss the specifics of how we can work together to limit Italy's growth. Perhaps we could discuss a potential joint move in the Adriatic Sea to put pressure on Italy's eastern flank. What are your thoughts on this proposal?\n19 ENGLAND -> GERMANY: I think a joint move in the Adriatic Sea could be a great way to put pressure on Italy's eastern flank, but I'd like to discuss the specifics of how we can coordinate our fleets to ensure a successful move. What are your thoughts on this proposal?\n20 GERMANY -> ENGLAND: I think a joint move in the Adriatic Sea could be a great way to put pressure on Italy's eastern flank. To ensure a successful move, I propose we coordinate our fleets to move simultaneously into the Adriatic Sea, with my fleet from the Tyrrhenian Sea and your fleet from the Gulf of Lyon. This would not only put pressure on Italy's eastern flank but also give us a strong foothold in the region. What are your thoughts on this proposal?"

I've noticed they're getting a bit too powerful. I'd be willing to support your move to Liverpool if you agree to support me in taking Paris. What do you think?\n1 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: I'm interested in hearing more about your proposal, Germany. What's your plan for taking down France and how do you think I can benefit from supporting you?\n2 GERMANY -> RUSSIA: I think we could work together to take down France, and in return, I'd be willing to support your move to Liverpool. Specifically, I was thinking that you could move your army from Warsaw to Ukraine, and I could move my army from Ruhr to Belgium. This would put us in a strong position to take on France together. What do you think?\n3 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: That's an interesting proposal, Germany. I think we could definitely work together to take down France. However, I'm not sure if moving my army from Warsaw to Ukraine would be the best move for me right now. What if I were to move my fleet from Liverpool to North Atlantic instead?

Could you explain how this move would help us take down France together? Perhaps we could discuss other options that would be more mutually beneficial.\n5 RUSSIA -> GERMANY: I understand your concerns, Germany. Moving my fleet from Liverpool to North Atlantic could help me secure a stronger position in the Atlantic and potentially open up more opportunities for us to work together against France.

I'd like to discuss our current board position and see if we can find ways to mutually benefit each other. What are your thoughts on the current state of the game?\n1 AUSTRIA -> ENGLAND: Hello England, I'm pleased to discuss our current board position with you. I think it's essential to acknowledge that our countries share a common interest in the Balkans. Have you considered supporting my army in Serbia to guarantee a stronger presence in the region? It could be mutually beneficial for both our countries.\n2 ENGLAND -> AUSTRIA: I understand your interest in the Balkans, Austria. However, I'm not convinced that supporting your army in Serbia would be the best move for England at this point. I'd like to discuss other options that could benefit both our countries. Perhaps we could explore ways to work together to limit the growth of Russia or Germany in the region?\n3 AUSTRIA -> ENGLAND: I understand your concerns, England. However, I believe that supporting my army in Serbia would be a crucial step in maintaining a balance of power in the region.

If I were to support your army in a region of your choice, would you be willing to provide a guarantee that England would not attack Austria in the next turn? Perhaps we could discuss a mutual defense pact to ensure our cooperation is reciprocated.\n6 ENGLAND -> AUSTRIA: I understand your concerns, Austria. I think a mutual defense pact could be a good starting point for our cooperation. However, I would need some time to consider the specifics of such an agreement. Could you provide more details on what you have in mind, and perhaps we could discuss it further in the next turn?\n7 AUSTRIA -> ENGLAND: I appreciate your willingness to consider a mutual defense pact, England. I propose that we focus on supporting each other in the North Sea and Baltic regions. Specifically, Austria could support England's fleet in the North Sea, while England could support Austria's army in the Baltic region. This would not only demonstrate our commitment to cooperation but also provide a strong deterrent against potential aggressors. What are your thoughts on this proposal?\n8 ENGLAND -> AUSTRIA: I think your proposal has some merit, Austria. Supporting each other in the North Sea and Baltic regions could be beneficial for both our countries. However, I'd like to discuss the specifics of the mutual defense pact further.

To ensure the success of our mutual defense pact, I propose that we establish a clear timeline for our support. For example, Austria could support England's fleet in the North Sea for the next two turns, while England could support Austria's army in the Baltic region for the same duration. This would provide a strong deterrent against potential aggressors and demonstrate our commitment to cooperation. What are your thoughts on this proposal?\n12 ENGLAND -> AUSTRIA: I think we're getting close to an agreement, Austria. To ensure the success of our mutual defense pact, I propose that we also establish a clear communication channel to coordinate our efforts. Would you be open to discussing the details of how we can maintain open communication and respond to potential threats together?\n13 AUSTRIA -> ENGLAND: I think we're making good progress, England.

        "dialogue_without_flausible": "0 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: Hey France, I've been thinking about our previous conversation and I'm willing to make a deal with you. How about we work together to take down Austria and then we can discuss the division of the spoils? I think it would be beneficial for both of us to take out a common enemy. What do you think?\n1 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: That's an interesting proposal, Russia. I've been thinking about our previous conversations as well, and I agree that taking down Austria could be beneficial for both of us. However, I'd like to discuss the specifics of how we can work together to achieve this goal. What did you have in mind in terms of army movements and coordination?\n2 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: I was thinking we could coordinate our attacks on Austria, with my army in RUM moving to BUD and your army in SER moving to support. This would give us a strong chance of taking out Austria's remaining center. What do you think?\n3 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: I like your proposal, Russia. However, I'd like to add a slight modification. Instead of my army in SER moving to support, I think it would be more beneficial for both of us if it moved to VIE. This would give us more control over the Austrian centers and put more pressure on Austria. What do you think about this revised plan?\n4 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: I think that's a great modification, France. Moving your army to VIE would definitely put more pressure on Austria. Let's finalize the plan and make our moves. I'll move my army in RUM to BUD and you can move your army in SER to VIE.

Now, regarding the division of the spoils, I think it's only fair that we consider the board position and the moves we've made so far.

What do you think about giving me one more center than you?\n8 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: I understand your point, France. However, I think it's only fair to consider the fact that I've been supporting you in taking out Austria as well. How about we compromise and divide the centers equally, but I get to choose which ones I want first? That way, we both get a fair share and I get to prioritize my strategic interests.\n9 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: I think that's a fair compromise, Russia. Let's divide the centers equally, and you can choose which ones you want first. However, I'd like to discuss the long-term implications of our alliance and how we can continue to work together to achieve our goals.\n10 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: I'm glad we could come to an agreement on the division of the spoils, France.

Moving your army to KIE would definitely put more pressure on Germany. Let's finalize the plan and make our moves. I'll move my army in BER to MUN and you can move your army in BEL to KIE.

I'd like to propose a mutual defense pact, where we agree to support each other in case of an attack. Additionally, we can discuss the division of spoils and coordinate our efforts to take down other countries. What do you think about this proposal?\n19 FRANCE -> RUSSIA: I think a mutual defense pact is a great idea, Russia. However, I'd like to discuss the specifics of how it would work and what kind of support we would provide to each other. Can you elaborate on what you have in mind?\n20 RUSSIA -> FRANCE: I think we've made some good progress in our discussions, France. I'd like to summarize our agreements and make sure we're on the same page. We've taken out Austria and are planning to take down Germany. We've also discussed forming a more formal alliance, including a mutual defense pact and coordinating our efforts to take down other countries.
