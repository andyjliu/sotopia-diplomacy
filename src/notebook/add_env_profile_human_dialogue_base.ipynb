You could use Austrian help in dealing with Russia, so only country that can be influenced to help Austria is Turkey.

With Liverpool in my control I plan to build new fleet to swing north and try to brake through to Norwegian sea and tie up considerable English forces there.  I think that in the next year if pressure on your borders remain strong we could pull little trick. Holland could move to Belgium in the fall and get yourself new army in Berlin to fight with Russia. If things are becoming really serious we might even consider moving Burgundy to Bohemia, but that would be last resort I guess.
